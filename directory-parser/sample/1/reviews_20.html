            A boy I liked said one day: "Have you heard 'Tank'? You have to hear 'Tank'."  He sent me the album version, and insisted any series with music this good has to be worth a watch.

             Most of the episodes are self contained, and oddly enough, it works.  It is actually easier to get hooked because even though there's a good overarching story with many small details, they're scattered throughout the series and you don't get bogged down with plot point overload.  The characters are consistent and realistic, and gradual changes happen along those oneshot stories.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             At the end of it all, the phenomenal
             <span id="review32545" style="display: none;">
              music is the shining star of this series.  Episode Five, "Ballad of Fallen Angels," is one of the best scored episodes of TV.  Period.  Yoko Kanno is a genius; she incorporates such a wide variety of music, and still manages to tie it together.

            Okay so I feel obliged to write up a review on my favorite animated space western of all time, Cowboy Bebop. I am not alone in that this show is widely acclaimed by many others as well. The moment I watched Bebop, I expected so much from anything I've watched since and not a lot can live up to Bebop, if any.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Story: 10
             <br/>
             <br/>
             So basically you have your main character Spike and his bounty hunting partner Jet Black patrolling the galaxy on their ship, the Cowboy Bebop. Along the way they pick up Faye, a woman with hardly any recollection of her past, Ein the smart
             <span id="review260699" style="display: none;">
              Welsh Corgi, and Ed, computer whiz. The plot of the story is different from many other fictional works; Bebop's plot isn't a core component of the show. It's all about how all of the characters develop over time. I'll talk about the characters in a little bit.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art: 9
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Still a somewhat older anime (19 years old sheesh!) but the art holds up from its debut. Still feels lively and more aesthetically pleasing than its counterparts over those couple of years but would be criticized if it were created today.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound: 10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I would rate it a 20 if I could. One of the best dubs ever? Check. A fucking amazing OST? Check. All time classing opening? You can honestly just label this as one of the best musically crafted shows not only in anime but in movies and TV as a whole. Any music fan questioning whether they want to watch anime for the first time must start with this show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters: 10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The main characters are all different and each have an in depth backstory carefully woven into the series. The main villain, Vicious is only in there for like 3 episodes and he still feels like a really important character in the series. If you believe in a silhouette test, this show literally has it in the opening and it definitely passes with flying colors.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoyment: 10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              If I weren't pressed for time when I started watching it, I would have watched it in one go. 8-9 hours straight of Bebop is just amazing in my head.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Recommendation:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Watch the show. If you're a hater wanting to find a bad review, watch the show. New to anime? Watch this. You've already watched Bebop and want to find other like-minded individuals? Watch it again. Also, listen to the whole OST on YouTube, shit is amazing to listen to during any circumstance.

            Finally, I had some time to write my first review this anime sure deserves much more.
            <br>
             <br/>
             This was really a great ride 26 episodes of enjoyment this series was really outstanding it had a lot of influence on me I really enjoyed it starting by:
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Story: Although it didn't have a major plot it was still enjoyable for an episodic show this was really one hell of a ride 9/10
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Art: The art was really special and unique not like these days anime which one eye is bigger than the other, to be honest, it was 85% like a Ghibli movie really outstanding, and it had a mix
             <span id="review255516" style="display: none;">
              of the western cartoon on it I really like that of course in a Japanese anime style. 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound: I really loved the voice actors they were really awesome and I thank them for their great work on this show, the sound effects were great for 1998 anime it was really outstanding. 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Character: I think this show was mostly successful because of the uniqueness of these four main characters as well as the others, each one had their own attitude and they didn't change it for some any reason except major things 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoyment: it was really enjoyable, but I would have loved it more if there was more dark and hopeless and despair in it 8/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall: it was a very Great show that I would definitely watch it again in the future. 9/10

            Oh Cowboy Bebop, how I adore you! If you have watched anime for any period of time you have at least heard about this series. It is an anime famous for its amazing and relaxed soundtrack, lovable characters and mature but fun story. Let us get started reviewing this work of art!
            <br>
             <br/>
             Story - 7/10
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Wait a minute, haven't I just been praising the series for being a work of art? How dare I give the story a 7/10. The thing about Cowboy Bebop story is that is extremely simplistic. Now is this necessarily a bad thing? Hell no! The relaxed story blends in perfectly with the
             <span id="review258276" style="display: none;">
              setting of Cowboy Bebop. It doesn't attempt to tell a story which explores some deeper meaning, because that isn't the goal of the series. The story helps you to learn to love the characters and the world in which they live.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art - 9/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              For the time in which this series was created, it packs some glorious animation. I love how much western influence is put into the world of Cowboy Bebop. Vivid, earthly, colors fit the western theme of the series, to mind-blowing planets, infrastructure and science fiction which is done on a realistic scale. The character design is nothing to be ashamed of either, sporting some of the literally coolest looking characters ever created.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound - 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Once again here comes the western influence of the anime. Great choice in music at the correct timing makes this series even more pleasant of a watch. The OP of the series fits perfectly with the relaxed and smooth tone of the series, while the ED ties in with the more serious moments within the anime. Whether you are a fan of more dated genres of music, like Jazz, Blues and Classical or not, this musical score will most definitely leave some sort of an impression on you. The voice acting is especially great in the Dub version of the series, with Steven Blum's portrayal of Spike Spiegel being one of the best examples of English dubbing within an anime.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Character - 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              One of the defining principals of any great entertainment medium is without a doubt the characters within the series/movie/anime/novel ect. This is yet another thing the anime does perfectly. Featuring some of the coolest characters to date as well as some of the quirkiest characters ever. From the cool and suave Spike, the reserved and wise Jet, the sexy and brilliant Faye or the adorable and innocent Ed, Cowboy Bebop is bound to have you hooked on one of the fantastic main characters. What Cowboy Bebop does better than almost most anime ever, is the way they portray their characters as human beings. They aren't some fictional characters which children aspire to be but someone you can relate towards.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoyment - 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Being a cynical piece of shit like myself, I really couldn't believe how much I enjoyed Cowboy Bebop and I ended up enjoying it  more than any other anime I have ever seen. The reason being is that the show takes all the elements I love from anime, sprinkle some heavy western influence on top, to create one of the best recipes for anime out there.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall - 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              If there ever was an anime out there to be dubbed as a Masterpiece, Cowboy Bebop would be my first candidate. Sporting incredible visuals, a soothing soundtrack and one of the best casts within an anime, Cowboy Bebop is an anime deserving of a 10/10 rating and I would recommend the series to anyone, because it has something to appease everyone.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Thank you so much for taking the time to read my review. Sorry if I come of as biased, but I tried to be objective and subjective when writing reviews.

            <br>
             So,finished Cowboy Bebop for the 2nd time now after many years.😁
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop is undoubtedly a Classic masterpiece that is impossible to criticize.
             <br/>
             A truly unique,strong &amp; very mature storyline based on a distant future,revolving around some very sophisticated &amp; well written characters,very cool &amp; realistic action/fight scenes that will keep you entertained thorughout the whole series,amazingly detailed &amp; soothing Artwork &amp; Animations that is rarely seen in animes these days  &amp; Of course there's those classy kickass soundtracks impossible to ignore.
             <br/>
             All in all,this is one of those classy animes that has no

              P.S-I really miss sexy &amp; mature woman like Faye Valentine 😍❤...This kind of beautifull,hot bad ass female characters are now extinct from animes these days...most of the lead female characters now are mostly lolies or moe moe shits.😑😑
              <br/>
              As they say,Old is gold..Most of the 90's famous animes I've seen yet are really amazing.

             Yet another show to cross off my list of "cult classic" animes. As expected of a show that shares the same director as Samurai Champloo, the pace and flow of the anime was fluid in its nonchalant transition between each episode and distinguished during. The overall story didn't matter as much as each individual event and this is where some of the artistry lies in this type of storytelling. It allows the viewer to be active in the moment and not anticipating the future or
             <span id="review259653" style="display: none;">
              dwelling on what happened in the past. In fact, every event seemed very real in its impromptu and freestyle...style (of course, just like jazz..). Nothing goes according to plan. Nothing happens to develop the story further on. Nothing is orchestrated for this ultimate grand scheme. Everything just happens.
              <br/>

              <br/>
              <br/>
              The characters were all exciting. Relatable by their individual sins and mannerisms. Jet who reluctantly (yet willingly) supports his partners when he could be saved the headache by ditching them. Spike who personifies the Bruce Lee mantra of "Be like water". Faye who similarly throws caution to the wind and loses it all in gambling. And Ed who, after acknowledging her technological gift, could not be described more accurately than as the epitome of any lackadaisical child ever born.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It begs the question of why a character should be stagnant on the spectrum they reside in. Should protagonists always be likable? Should antagonists always be detested? It is not easy to make a character who fluctuates in personality in a way that doesn't seem targeted or intentional. So we commonly see in a lot of modern day writing (not necessarily a majority, mind you) that good guys are good and bad guys are bad.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I constantly became frustrated with each characters despite my previous acceptance of their flaws. But I could say the same of my closest friends and I'm sure they could say worse of me. At the end of the day, no matter their mistakes, mischief, or misconduct, characters should be as complex as the people we love and hate.
              <br/>

              <br/>
              The music was very good. I, for one, have a hard time sustaining a long term imprint from musical scores so forgive me if I can't provide a more structured opinion on it. I can at least tell you that I enjoyed it very well and all of it, of course, was in good taste.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The art and animation were incredible. Specific background arrangements and positioning were important. Beautiful landscape shots. Dynamic choreography and animation from hand to hand and gun fights. (Sounds pretty copypasta from my Champloo review?) Everything seemed painstakingly thoughtout and not for a moment did they consider half assing a single frame. Well.. except for the time they used a 3D model, but hey, maybe it seemed really damn cool in 1998.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              All in all, I am simply another brick in the wall supporting this house of Bebop.

            So, Cowboy Bebop was one of the many animes, that everyone talks, or talked, or mentions time to time, and I thought, might as well give it a shot. And thanks Dog I didn't miss this title.
            <br>
             Don't get me wrong, the story isn't any kind of extraordinary, it has quite a few filler episodes, I guess, that's every TV show's curse. But it's not the point. Cowboy Bebop combines together what at first glance looks like incompatable things: wild west thrill, space journey and ganster movies. You have: native americans, jazz and funk, bandits, corrupted society full of punks, countless criminals and headhunters (aka
             <span id="review254378" style="display: none;">
              cowboys). And that 20-30's USA aesthethic really blends in well with sci-fi elements.
              <br/>
              But what I think really keeps you watching is character depth. Every single character has a mysterious past, and that makes you want to uncover that and get the big picture. And to answer your question, yes, they do not fail at doing that.
              <br/>
              Overall, this is classic. I've recently started to explore the world of japanese animation, and if you're like me, this is a must-watch. It's really an important part of anime history.
              <br/>
              P.S.: On the side note, I gotta say, Cowboy Bebop looked and felt like Firely to me. If you don't know what this is, this is 2002 TV show (non-anime) broadcasted by FOX. So, if you feel like you want something really similar, check out that as well.

            Cowboy Bebop: highly rated in the anime community, abnormally well received outside of the anime community, accompanied by a cult fan-base... sounds too good to be true...
            <br>
             <br/>
             But I must say, that I don't believe the show has helped with any cures to diseases, scientific achievements, breakthroughs in technology, or advances in diplomatic relationships.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             So I guess it does have flaws.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             But if you haven't watched this show and are an anime fan, or even if you are just browsing this website, then you have spent some time devoted to anime that could've been better spent watching this show.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I find it a shame that anime is clouded by
             <span id="review247016" style="display: none;">
              people who complain about the episodic nature of the show. Compared to Bebop, a series that relies on overly-dramatic cliff-hangers is shallow. Bebop is developed: from the complexity of the characters (if you only see the main cast as their surface presents, I suggest to rewatch and pay more attention to the details of the characters pasts, as well as their present) to the vivid animation (and I don't mean flashy colors, I mean how the pieces move, their shape, design, etc...)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Lastly, the quality of the music can not be understated. Almost every single anime on the earth suffers from its cliched garbage music. Thank you Bebop, for bringing us a soundtrack that I don't want to skip over, but I can even call a masterpiece.

            One of the all-time anime greats, Cowboy Bebop was a series that went well beyond what to offer up for a 1990s TV anime series in terms of both presentation and storytelling quality. Focused on the exploits of the members of a group of bounty hunters aboard the Bebop spaceship, the series mixes around episodic and ongoing storylines to tell its different tales involving Spike, Jet, Faye, Ein and Ed as they hunt down criminal targets and come to confront tragic elements of their pasts.
            <br>
             <br/>
             The storytelling approach to Bebop was unique for its time (and still holds up to this day) as many titles in
             <span id="review199165" style="display: none;">
              the 1990s either offered an ongoing plot line or focused on episodic developments with its cast. Here in Bebop though, the storytelling focus is more fragmented as episodes are either devoted to exploring the Bebop crew going after a bounty that are mostly self-contained or dealing with issues related to their past that offer more ongoing development as the series progresses, particularly with Spike and Faye's stories. Each episode helps to explore more to the world of the series or flesh out another major element to one of the Bebop crew's developments. They also have varying moods and themes explored throughout the show's run, offering a mix of film noir, westerns, sci-fi, horror, comedy, action, mind screw and drama throughout the show's run. The show is heavily influenced through Western pop culture, and it shows with its homages and parodies to popular Western media franchises and figures like Batman, Gunsmoke, Alien and Bruce Lee.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Bebop depicts a realistic approach to its sci-fi world, preferring to apply a mix of scientific advances like astral gates and spaceships with settings that closely resemble those found within the modern era unlike the futuristic settings that titles like Akira or Outlaw Star would portray. Planets and moons colonized by humanity look more like modern era cities, each having their own varying issues with criminals, poverty and corruption. In addition, ships like the Bebop and Spike's Swordfish ship are regarded as relics of a past era by those having more modern spaceships via the standards of their time period.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Visually, Cowboy Bebop is easily among one of the 1990s most impressive looking titles. It offers vast settings that have a good deal of detail and take place in a variety of settings that include space, cities, mountains and sewers. Many characters are drawn with lifelike and realistic details, not sporting the typical “big eyed” anime look you would expect of many titles with characters sporting a variety of looks and some being attractive without going overboard with the looks, like Faye and Spike. Animation is consistently fluid throughout the series and applied in a variety of ways throughout Bebop's run that include physical fights, gun fights, spaceship fights, realistic physics applied to floating in space and evading incoming obstacles like gunfire or wreckage. CG animation is employed for some of the show's more elaborate animated sequences like computer screens and space wreckage, but these bits are rendered so well that they fit seamlessly in with the show's regular animation.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The soundtrack to Bebop is just as excellent, taking on the same Western influences that the show's storytelling elements employ as it milks use of Western genres like jazz, blues, country and hard rock to flow along with its presentation. Composed by famous anime composer Yoko Kanno, Bebop is easily among one of anime's best soundtracks that you can listen to, whether watching the series or enjoying just the music itself.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              With its high-quality presentation and storytelling that are heavily Western influenced, Cowboy Bebop is easily among the very best offerings that the medium of anime has to offer with its excellent storytelling, visuals, soundtrack and characterization for a TV anime that is easily accessible to both newcomer and veteran alike.

            Cowboy Bebop, so many memories are etched into my mind from back when I was a kid, though I was relatively young, watching the later episodes on Toonami was a great time. So surreal, tragic and adventurous.

             Story (9)
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Fantastic story, one of which consists of a group ill-fit yet dynamic posse of bounty-hunters traveling though space. People may not like the overall sporadic stories within each episode (or the show itself). However, I found that the chain of events really captured the life of a bounty-hunter. This is described as (to me) people who lost their way, have nowhere to go and are trying to
             <span id="review202924" style="display: none;">
              make ends meet in a crazy universe. For me, the show describes a universe of lost belonging, where life is limitless but can be pointless. For this show's time, I believe the range of its adventurous characteristics sparks ones imagination, engrossing them to watch more. The show itself, like really, Cowboys in space, you don't get as original as that. The originality is perfect and I have no clue of any genre that can be as similar and execute this so well. I guess the most prominent message of this anime was how to deal with your haunting past. Everyone has some skeletons in their closet, but sometimes the past might be difficult to cope with. For this, I was really pleased.

              Art (8)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              For the art, I did not expect too much considering when this came out. I love how the art (at least to me) was reminiscent of the past, sort of hazy and incomplete. But the backgrounds were drawn out nicely, setting the mood for each scene perfectly (especially the later episodes). Because of this it flows with the concept of a surreal and curious past. But nonetheless, the art style was memorable and all the other aspects of the anime made up for some of lesser part of the animation.

              Sound (9)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Let me just inform you that I watched the dub (because my inner child called for it). For a dub, I thought It was great. The characters seemed to match and play well with the schemas of the characters. The voices slipped once in a while but still, I thought the tone and overall VA's played their part well in fitting in with the atmosphere of the anime collectively. I thought there could of been more background audio though, that was a little disappointing. It was almost like the background was nonexistent at times, just unreal, fake and "dead". The background audio could of been a bit louder but thats me. Lastly, one thing I remember and will always remember is the OP and ED. Those tunes are symbolic and really caught the anime overall attitude. At the beginning, you're pumped and ready for adventure. The idea of a fast paced life of a space cowboy is etched within this seemingly vintage classic of a song. But at the end, the world is full of regret, the sun is set and is sailing on, leaving behind your past (or are you?). The Real Folk Blues.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Character (9.5)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters were a great bunch. The mismatch of this group all had their unique and memorable ambiance. Even the nonverbal Ein was amazing. Everyone had a past that was unique and stepped in at some point in the anime. The characters were relatable and I thought were well rounded for the development of the anime. I won't go into character detail because I would like the viewers to analyze and interpret the characters for themselves.

              Enjoyment (10)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              First off, I do not believe that my enjoyment was led astray by childhood memories. The show was addictive, adventurous, funny and tragic at times. A perfect mix that made me want to binge watch the show. However, I knew that I would need to savor this gem to really absorb the material. And Boy I was glad. Watching this anime was really a treat that allowed me to forget my worries and troubles of daily life. It made me smile and it made me wonder. For me, I tend to create a deeper meaning that seems to enhance my appreciation of the Cowboy Bebop. Simply fantastic.

            I can understand those who say all the praise CB gets is undeserved and that the anime is overrated. For the first six or ten episodes, I had  this feeling that people nowadays just uncritically praise what has established itself in the mainstream for decades, Cowboy Bebop being one those cases. The only thing that kept me watching the show for these first impressions was the Opening Theme, by far the best I've ever heard and probably the best there is out there. It feels timeless, special and different, easily standing out from all the pop punk screamo bands that feature in these day's
            <span id="review248013" style="display: none;">
             animes and are just downright annoying and generic.
             <br>
              <br/>
              But a instrumental jazzy song can't carry a whole anime on its amazing harmonic shoulders, of course.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              What made Cowboy Bebop special to me, first of all, is exactly what I least enjoy in other animes: episodic narratives. The repetitiveness of a formula that is abused in each episode - (slight) variation of a same theme -  is extremely boring to me. Gladly, that's not the case for CB.
              <br/>
              Seemingly apathetic bounty-hunters in space can sound uninteresting for those who dislikes westerns like me, but when it comes to Cowboy Bebop, it is not the same trope, it is not the same formula.
              <br/>
              Spike, Jet and their crew face uniquely special adventures each episode, which perfectly incorporates and embraces the sci-fi theme into the narrative. The episodes themselves had this sort of short-movie like quality that wasn’t uncreative in the least. Some were pretty simple, like the ones portraying the life of the crew inside Bebop, but still, it added dynamic to a trope that seemed to be constrained by the dystopian side of sci-fi (not really in the context of the 90’s, I guess).
              <br/>
              The gist of the show, or should I say, the closing of Spike’s arc is only disclosed in the end of the show. It wasn’t anything mind-blowing or  beautifully crafted like a ancient greek tragedy, it felt just like The End. Some might say it was just irresponsible, but the magic of the entire anime didn’t fade in my eyes.
              <br/>
              The art is just out-of-this-world beautiful. For me that means that I can see things as they are: no flare, no sparks, no needless reflective objects, just plain urban-like scenario and the flick of a cigarette, my favorite aesthetic. The characters sometimes look taller than usual, or just pretty asymmetrical sometimes, but, well, that doesn’t bother me at all.
              <br/>
              Except for the delay in disclosing each character’s background, and sometimes doing a poor job at that, the overall work feels like a 10 for me. I’ve never experienced watching something like that, and I feel grateful.

            To begin, I will say that I rarely watch anime anymore, and when I do nowadays it's usually older ones that weren't/aren't mainstream. I left all of that shonen stuff back in middle-early high school where it belongs (I'm already nearing 30). I try to watch more nowadays, it's just there is rarely any anime that pulls me in, but I digress.

             Great music, great setting, great art, great characters, meh overarching plot. In the end it was little above average. When it was good it was REALLY good. When it wasn't it dragged on forever and I couldn't wait to get to the next
             <span id="review248384" style="display: none;">
              episode already.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I didn't really have any expectations going in other than forums recommending it. But it started to wane around halfway through the series. I understand that the anime is episodic (I've greatly enjoyed other episodic animes like Baccano! and Samurai Champloo), but a number of episodes around the middle of the series clearly stood out to me as not as enjoyable to watch.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Story-wise, what CB ends up being for me is simply a story of existing. "Simply" being the keyword here because I feel like that is the reason why the show didn't wow me, yet however, it was uniquely bland. Everything simply existed; happened. I think that's part of the beauty of it; it wasn't anything special. No mind-blowing philosophical themes are shoved in your face a la Psycho Pass. No big revelations or thrills. Life in the universe of CB simply is what it is, and like the ending, it just goes on. Implicitly, there is a lot to say there that takes a little finesse to figure out.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I will say that CB is a damn good gem. I haven't seen anything like it. But it didn't blow me away. It was subtle. I don't think I would want to rewatch it anytime soon. Maybe when I'm a lot older again and life has taken its course.

             Cowboy Bebop is the first anime that I've watched from start to finish that didn't leave me with a, "OMG THAT WAS SO FCKUING GOOD SFETGSTIOERLF" feeling. It's not that I didn't like it, I mean obviously since I watched the entire thing, but the story left me a little...unsatisfied tbh. Idk betweenn Faye who was annoying as fuck (except in the last episode) and all this other shit that happened, I expected so much but was left with so little really. I can see why it's managed to stay in the top 30 for so long, but it just wasn't for
             <span id="review252426" style="display: none;">
              me. But it was good, but Idk. If the story had managed to end in a slightly positive light whilst at the same time making Faye less annoying over time, I would've liked it more, but it sucked in regards of story and character. The only character who was introduced that didn't annoy me was Ed. I liked her so much I made my first gifset in awhile out of her (if you wanna see then here https://animeesthetic.tumblr.com/post/162791514595)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As for the music and art, well the art was good. And the music inspired the material for my 4th Nocturne (I' m a composer), which is why I'm giving this anime a 9.While the music was good enough to inspire me, the characters and their development over the course of the show was heavily lacking and the story was a little bit too downtrodden (although tbh I expected Spike to die in the end), but it wasn't enough to kill my overall enjoyment thanks to the music and Ed. So yeah.

            Nineteen years ago, during the year 1998, a Space Western anime was released by the name of Cowboy Bebop, an anime that would go on to become one of the finest pieces of animation ever made. Adapted and completely redesigned from its manga counterpart, with direction by Shinichirō Watanabe, this 26-episode long, seinen neo-noir anime series would continue to astound fans of the medium for decades to come.
            <br>
             <br/>
             The episodes for the show tend to be very episodic in nature, usually in two-parts, with stunning fluidity from one space romp to the next. Even though most of the episodes are unrelated, there’s never a disjointed feeling
             <span id="review251546" style="display: none;">
              of randomness, or having any kinds of fillers simply to bulk out the serial. It all fits wonderfully. Everything just belongs, nothing more and nothing less. When we do have story-specific arcs, they are laced with emotional intensity and the complexities that go with having a past you’re not so fond of. There’s so much grey in between the black and white that each character is portrayed to be multidimensional and so much more than a pretty face, or an intellectual genius.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The chemistry between all of the members of Bebop is one of my absolute favourite elements. They are flawed as fuck human beings, with quirks that cause a lot of grating disagreements and vexing (for them, not the audience) interactions. Nonetheless, they all have a key component in common that holds them together like a dysfunctional family. No matter how many times they try to walk away, eventually they find themselves back home. This is realistic. It’s believable. It’s something to connect with. Some will have a much more intimate relation to it than others. It’s comforting.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As I mentioned earlier, the animation, regardless of being almost 20 years old, still holds up really damn well. The power is in the details, literally. There are so many details that went into establishing the environments within the series that the best way to describe it is breath-taking. Whether the setting is the interior (or even exterior) of a ship, space itself, planets with crumbling or bustling cities, the characters themselves and the expressions that they make—it’s all extremely astounding. These little soft lines and harsh curves with unique shades of red, blue, and orange all create the mood and tone for which makes Bebop a bonafide neo-noir experience.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Even with all of these awesome traits, none of it really means anything if you can’t look beyond the animation and the cast to see just how far ahead of its time Cowboy Bebop truly was.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It’s 1998 and gender roles are getting less defined. This show broke gender moulds back then, and it continues to do so in the modern age. You have women, beautiful women and average women and women from all walks of life in regards to race, ethnicity, etc., who are never judged for being just that. They are portrayed as very strong, independent ass-kickers. It didn’t matter if they were criminals, heroes, or in between somewhere. The women in the show are some of the most intelligent people, and it’s never questioned or treated like it’s some kind of phenomenon. Good examples of badass ladies include Faye Valentine, Julia, and a very special bartender who’s a good friend of Spike’s (name’s not given to avoid spoilers).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              One of our main characters, Edward, is a teenage girl, but it’s rarely brought up. Hell, her name is Edward. People don’t really care if she’s a she. Ed is a genius and eccentric as all fuck, and quite androgynous. Her brilliance is what makes her a compelling character. Yes, some people do gander at her gender, but it’s more of a passing curiosity. Her ability to do what she does is never doubted or questioned because of her being a girl. Most of the doubt stems from her sensationally unique persona and young age. We have another character in one of the episodes that’s a hermaphrodite. While it’s a bit uncommon, it never becomes the focal point of who he is or what he does. He’s just another person in the galaxy who’s got his own burden to bear.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So, yeah, gender roles and our ridiculous pre-conceived notions of what gender means doesn’t mean shit in this anime. I fucking love it.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              A more common motif in the series is the belief that you are always a master of your own choices and leader of your own fate. Life is something to do with what you will, which is clearly exhibited by the decisions taken by our motley crew of criminal hunters, especially as their pasts begin to surface and reveal itself. Allowing yourself to be held back by some predetermined ideals that you may not even believe in isn’t living. The idea of having “obligations” and that there’s always an inherent “right” and “wrong,” is utterly false in the grand scheme of things and don’t account for jack shit if you’re going to be miserable in the end. This motif is beautifully complimented and further ingrained by the music…
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Something else that gives the series loads and loads of depth is… the music. I’m sure that anyone reading this review that’s already had a chance to watch this anime was probably wondering when I’d bring this up. Well, here it comes. Hold on to your butts, my friends.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Yoko Kanno is quite possibly one of the most brilliant composers of the modern age. Her work has made appearances in many anime serials across the board from Wolf’s Rain to Terror in Resonance and a few others; each one a magnificent and stellar feat of musical capacities. Yet, I don’t think she can ever really top what she’s accomplished with Cowboy Bebop.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The Seatbelts is the fictitious Japanese space jazz band led by Kanno. The name derives from how the performers wear seatbelts to be safe as they participate in some serious hard-core jam sessions. This band, put together by Kanno, is responsible for all of the music in Cowboy Bebop.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The styles of music utilised is enthrallingly diverse and ranges from straight big band jazz to blues, acoustic ballads, hard rock, and country to funk and electronic. Hip-hop and experimental compositional elements also make their appearances. Aside from sounding extraordinary, the music in and of itself speaks volumes of what the show is about. If you look at most, if not all, of these genres, they began during periods of history where a voice of rebellion needed to rise. It was a means for people to expel their frustrations at life and all of the bullshit that they had to endure. Blues is a very depressing genre, originally created to voice the hardships that came from slavery and oppression. Jazz became a significant boom during the 1920s when war was looming and young folks were forced to fight or choose a side; when a passionate desire for independence was boiling to its peak. This included the rise of women’s empowerment and freedom of choice.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Every genre used to create the tunes began as a fight against being oppressed and having severely limited rights, if you had any to begin with. The music was about growing up and facing your fears and your monsters, to make life what you wanted of it. These genres were all born out of necessity to have something powerful and positive to believe in; a way to share the pain so you could stop it from continuing onwards.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As I mentioned earlier, this theme is apparent in all four members of our cast—Faye Valentine, Jet Black, Spike Spiegel, and even Edward. They all had something they were fighting for and some strong personal beliefs that drove them to become the people that they became; changes that needed to be made so they could be the stronger, better versions of their old selves.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop has so much more to it than the few things I’ve mentioned in this insanely long ass review. To be blunt, I wish I could talk about all of them because that’s how much I loved this series. I’m so passionate about it and what it means and what it stands for. But if I chat about everything, then you guys may not want to pick it up (if you haven’t already). I know that hype can have a negative effect on me; look at how long it took me to pick up the series.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              While I do regret not picking it up sooner, I’m supremely satisfied with the fact that I waited so long. The world is a terribly different place now than it was in 1998. Not only was I just a child, there honestly wasn’t much that I could’ve related to the show back then as there is now, at least for me as an individual watcher. Maturity aside, I feel like the messages that are shared so passionately and so brilliantly in this anime are far more superior and relevant in 2017 than they would’ve been in 1998. But the fact that is was made 20 years ago, just goes to show you how far ahead of its time it truly was, which further intensifies my love for the science-fiction genre, no matter the medium.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In conclusion, I want to make one thing very clear: Cowboy Bebop is what it is, is as powerful and as remarkable as it is, because everything fits together so nicely. If you remove even one small facet of the show, it would’ve fallen completely apart. The music, any one of the characters (including minor ones), the animation, the motifs—anything at all and it wouldn’t be a work of art. It’s complex and intricate because every single piece makes it so; they’ve all got their place. Lose a single one and you’ve got nothing but a mediocre space western. Details are what create a masterpiece, especially when they’re subtle and natural.
              <br/>

            (I try to keep my reviews short and sweet and straight to the point without giving away spoilers with that said lets get this show on the road)
            <br>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop , is an old school, well thought out /planned anime. Anime's like these are so hard to fine. Something that is easy to follow and understandable. Most anime's nowadays are so colorful, with great animation but the story line and characters are completely shot.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Story- The story gives off an original feel. Every episode left be wanting more and it was so easy to follow. However, there were too many plots they tried to squeeze into
             <span id="review248526" style="display: none;">
              a 26 episode series. Some questions were never answered. I believed that they tried to cover up these lapses with one big plot overall.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art- The art was so retro. I loved it!! It totally took you back to a time were details to each character (no matter the importance or stance) was important.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound- The voice actors did a great job with bringing these character to life.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Character- Some characters were develop more than others, which was a complete let down. They opened the flood gates but never closed it. Nonetheless, no character was completely left alone as a filler. Some episodes were completely dedicated to one character. Thus, it gave the reviewer a deeper sense of each main character.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall- I enjoyed this anime. I loved the style and how the creators used there own creative spirits to make this anime come to life. Overall it's a wonderful anime and I would recommend it to anyone.

            Cowboy Bebop is one of the anime that can be regarded as the best science fiction anime in the 90s era. I’ve also been watching this anime for a long time and this anime is very different from many aspects when compared to anime nowadays. We know that nowadays, fans are more interesting in an idol, moe, waifu, harem, and so on that, the story in the anime is forgotten. I also really like the things like that but this is one that causes why the anime is best compared to the anime of the 90s. If watching at the present time, Cowboy Bebop loses
            <span id="review261380" style="display: none;">
             the sensation of the terms I mentioned earlier but if glanced from various aspects ranging from artwork to storyline, Cowboy Bebop is said to be the best sci-fi anime of 1998.
             <br>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is a masterpiece of Sunrise Studio that tries to produce something different from others series. It might be rather difficult to explain why this anime is so great for reviewers and critics. In fact, even in the international world is always glorified by this masterpiece. First of all, let’s try to think that this is not an anime. Cowboy Bebop is like a series made by a successful American from its novel adaptation. This series is made as if it were watched by adults only, who love the action movie and science fiction. Cowboy Bebop like a Trigun or Black Lagoon that can only be watched by adults only, although for the present is also very difficult to find anime of this kind. If it’s made, it may fail greatly because of the market demand that is off the mark.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is an image that successfully raised the anime to the international world. That is why outsider more prefer this anime over other anime. As Orson Scott Card says, an American novelist, critic, and public speaker: Cowboy Bebop has turned a perception of what people always say badly about anime. Cowboy Bebop managed to make the anime better than its stereotype as a story that made it a big achievement in the sci-fi genre. Cowboy Bebop is more aimed at the episodic system and focuses more on becoming itself like an American Serial TV that always has a continuous plot from time to time like one of the anime that I have reviewed also titled Monster. Both series have a continuous plot so that many people who are very interested to watch both the series even those who don’t like anime will also like it.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              For the size of the Cowboy Bebop series, it can be said to be like the Samurai Champloo series which I have also reviewed. Both series are more focused on a genre of action even though the author seems not to focus on that genre. Both series also sometimes have an unpredictable story ranging from characters to existing stories. Each episode feels random because sometimes we will be made laughing, sometimes we will be made touched, and sometimes we will be amazed of his action. In essence, both series are very difficult to guess. Just like the Monster series, sometimes we are always surprised to be plot-twisty in every episode. Cowboy Bebop has an impressing story that neatly and sensibly enough to be surprised because of this series.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              One more thing about this series is that although this series is titled “Cowboy” in its title, this series doesn’t focus on the theme of the cowboy. We will be amazed by a very cool space-shaped cowboy. Sounds weird, right? For some people, it may sound strange. Why you have to create a nonsense story like this? Hold on, dude. Cowboy Bebop takes on the feel of exoticism and the culture of outsiders like the Indians living in a desert on Mars, a Red Dragon syndicate who always believes in mystical things, Vicious who relies more on katana in some of his battles, and Spike Siegel who owns Jeet Kune Do. Of course, the sci-fi elements aren’t lost out like a western movie with sophisticated technologies.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is a masterpiece that everyone should be obliged to watch it. Although this series has been long enough, this series still remains to watch but for you who like it. I was also a bit lazy to watch it when the beginning of the first episode started, but I forced myself to watch it to the end and managed to understand what this series is trying to explain us.

            My favorite thing about Cowboy Bebop is how motley of a crew they all are and the interaction between characters. The action is ok but nothing special. But character development is where this anime really excels. They pretty much go into everyone's backstory well enough to give you a good idea of what makes them tick.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Can move along a bit slow at times but for the most part has a good mixture of comedy, action; seriousness and sillyness.

            Cowboy Bebop was about the second anime I ever watched.  I never could catch it all the time when it was on Adult Swim but thanks to online episodes and movie rentals I finally got to see it all about two years ago.  What caught my attention was the art.  The art is more real to life than some anime and really spoke to me.  The sound tract was great, I even hunted down and bought the OST.  The characters were unique and worked well together in the crazy futuristic setting.  The story was good over all and several
            <span id="review38754" style="display: none;">
             episodes stood out and re-watched many times.  All said it is a great anime and worthy of being called an anime classic.

            It’s probably pointless to review this series at this point. Cowboy Bebop already has so much acclaim from the Anime community that another positive review would just be so much white noise. The reason I even bother to write this is because, for once, I actually found a series that lived up to its immense hype.
            <br>
             <br>
              I don’t want this review to be nothing but comparisons to Samurai Champloo, but seriously, this has “Shinichiro Watanabe” written all over it. The two series feel very similar: a cast of flawed but likable characters, traveling from place to place, getting into trouble and as time goes by we
              <span id="review75227" style="display: none;">
               come learn about their mysterious pasts. Jet is the quintessential big brother we all wish we had, Edward is hilarious, (I didn’t really care for Faye, she doesn’t seem to contribute much) and as for Spike? Oh Lord, Spike Spiegel is a BAD-ASS!!! He kicks all kinds of ass, he has a bad-ass spacecraft, and he’s a strong three-dimensional character who does everything with such gravitas. These are the people you wish were your friends in real life.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Another strong point of the series we can attribute to Watanabe is the atmosphere. The mish-mash of different genres, Western to Sci-fi and everything in between, gives this series an art style that has never been seen before. No other anime has dared to combine cigarettes and spaceships, and I don’t believe any other director could bring this concept to life. But who could supply the sounds necessary to accompany this visual feast? As always, Yoko Kanno delivers. I don’t think the music score is as memorable as Champloo’s, (the exception being “Green Bird” from episode five) but it was the perfect fit and helped to set the tone of the series. Side note: “Tank!” IS the greatest opening theme for an anime ever written.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               As for the voice-acting, I watched the English Dub, and now I understand why this Dub gets so much attention. Not a single character is miscast. Not one. Every random Joe on the street, all the numerous side characters that come and go throughout the series, they all serve their exact purpose: sound realistic while not distracting from what else may be going on. Of course, the real stars of the show are the main characters. These are some of the most believable performances I think I've ever heard. Steve Blum’s role as Spike Spiegel truly speaks for itself. (No pun intended)
               <br/>
               <br/>
               As much as I want to give this series a perfect score, there was one thing that didn’t sit well with me. Whenever I finish watching an anime, I ask myself “so what exactly can I take away from this series?” Honestly, I can’t really find an answer for that question. Perhaps, it will come to me at a later date, but for now I see this series as kind of pointless. By the end of Cowboy Bebop’s run, it doesn’t feel like much has been accomplished. Don’t get me wrong, I loved watching these characters interact; but as a narrative Bebop feels lacking.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               They say it’s not about the destination; it’s about the journey itself, and this jazzy space odyssey was one hell of a journey. Cowboy Bebop was loved in its time, it’s loved now, and it will continue to be loved far into the future. You owe it to yourself to watch this series.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Bang.

            Finding the words to describe Cowboy Bebop proved to be more difficult than I imagined. The series is a true masterpiece of animation and one of few that genuinely deserves a 10 rating across the board.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Of all the elements in the show, the one worthy of special mention is the music score, composed by Yoko Kanno. It is undoubtedly some of the most atmospheric music of any series and one the show is best known for.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The plot is nonlinear. While each character has an underlying agenda, it is their environment that ultimately decides where life takes them. Scripting for the show is exceptional; episodes are
             <span id="review27690" style="display: none;">
              nicely varied and the dialogue is very well-written and spoken from the mains to the supporting.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Besides the music, the next most recognizable aspect of the series is the characters. Each and every one of them has a meticulous design and personality, backed with outstanding art, fluid animation and excellent voice acting. All of this, combined with the aforementioned material, comes together in the form of realistically fleshed out and convincing figures.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop, in every regard, is a show of excellence. It more than backs its legacy and name among anime with painstaking visuals, beautiful music and believable characters. A must watch.
