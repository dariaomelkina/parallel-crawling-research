            Bebop is one of the best animes of all time. Loaded with action, comedy, drama, romance, all in a sci-fi setting; it is a classic. Best english dub ever... I don't think I've ever seen an entire episode in Japanese.
            <br>

             Memorable characters. Spike is my favorite anime character of all time; my Spike Spiegel Messenger Bag might just be one of the best purchases I've ever made.

             Awesome music. I listen to the soundtrack every single day. The jazz is amazing, as only Yoko Kanno and The Seatbelts could make such a spectacle. It's the main reason for my favorite radio station being CD101.9

            Cowboy Bebop directed by Shinchiro Watanabe is one of, if not the best anime that has ever been made. You can call it unoriginal, predictable and you can say that the story is too rigid. The thing is, no other anime has done something like this with so much style and finesse.
            <br>
             <br/>
             When I decided to write this review the best thing I could compare it to for me, was the video game The Last of Us, one of the most critically acclaimed and best games of all time. The story, the writing, the characters all kinda cliche, but what it does is perfect it
             <span id="review159517" style="display: none;">
              like no other work in the medium has. But saying this, the last of us has been out for a year and who knows when it will be beaten. Bebop has lasted for over fifteen years as the most beautiful and artistically, for the lack of better words, 'nailed it'. I emplore anyone who loves anime to watch this before they die, because no one has or will recreated the magic of Bebop.

            Shinichirō Watanabe's badass space western Cowboy Bebop prepares viewers for an exciting adventure of the galaxy's hottest new frontiersmen. As an intricately crafted composition of natural characters, passionate music, dark tones, and relatable themes, this epic stands the test of time as one of Japanese animation's finest masterpieces.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Story (read the synopsis first!)
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Structurally, episodes, throughout the series and hereafter referred to as "sessions", focus on isolated events, pertaining either to a particular bounty, backstory, or random "filler" event. Fans of stories that are less structured and more character oriented will be satisfied in that sense, as the main plot of Spike's conflict with crime lord Vicious
             <span id="review238896" style="display: none;">
              and the Red Dragon crime syndicate appears in tight bursts throughout the series. However, despite the disjointed pattern, the series flows in a way that leaves the viewer feeling satisfied and never disconnected from any particular character.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              A welcome positive of the writing is the no-holds-barred attitude the writers take in regards to the plot. The world of Bebop is a harsh, unforgiving world, and even down to the gritty end we find that no single character is safe. Though at times you may feel emotionally pained over a decision they made, in the end you'll understand it was the right one to make.

              Despite most episodes being good fun, Cowboy Bebop thematically provides a strong insight into the nature of isolation, purpose of existence, and consequences of the past. Spike is the principal instrument used by writers to convey thematic discourse, though mirrors of this behavior is seen in equally troubled partners Faye and Jet as well. Without spoiling too much, know that you'll view the deeply human struggles of the protagonists (and antagonists) with an air of familiarity and understanding.

              Genre and Characteristics
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Now, we can't be having "cowboys" and "bounties" without a little action, can we? Cowboy Bebop is a western by design, and with that comes adventure, hardship, and yes, fighting. Between hand-to-hand combat, bar fights, cosmic dogfighting, and katanas (yes, fucking katanas), a viewer's bloodlust will consistently be sated through the variety of action scenes present. Honestly, for the time in which this series was released, you'll be thoroughly impressed by how awesome everything looks.

              As the series is set in a futuristic version of today's galaxy, science fiction plays an integral part in world development. Spaceships and hyperspace gateways replace most of today's logistics of automobiles and highways. Earth has been made mostly inhabitable, and as a result, humans live mostly on other planets in the solar system (notably Mars). Each planet retains its own personality and atmosphere, shown vibrantly through the respective color palettes, architecture, and populations. Multi-culturalism is heavily prevalent throughout the locales, with regions mimicking that of Tijuana, New York, or Beijing. Telebroadcasts are often noted as being available in multiple languages, leading us to believe there is a sense of globalism and unity throughout the galaxy. Watanabe's colonized galaxy certainly does create an interesting perspective of what the future for humanity may be like.

              <br/>
              Animation
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Surprisingly enough, Cowboy Bebop retains animation quality advanced for its time. Watanabe and Sunrise Studios overall proved themselves throughout as being able to maintain a high standard of quality. There's a certain amount of fluidity present within most motions, and characters react naturally and often under a given circumstance.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I found myself constantly in awe with was how stellar (no pun intended) the cinematography was throughout the anime. Watanabe understood how vital camera shots were to conveying what was to be expressed. When new locales are introduced, there was a frequent use of panning long shots to convey the relative size of the world. A juxtaposition is formed between the characters and the world, showing how insignificant humanity is to the greater above, tying in well with the thematic tone of the anime. Atmosphere is never in question with how masterfully each one is produced. Color tones, camera angles, and character placement all help to convey the intended feeling of a shot.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              One of the common "sins" found within anime is that the "show, don't tell" rule is often disregarded in favor of a dialogue driven exposition. The latter is true for Cowboy Bebop, as we learn of the lore of the future galaxy through visually seeing it. For example, despite being a civilization that has managed space travel, there are still many pockets of poverty present as evident in many episodes. Spike's mysterious past is never spoken out in detail, rather throw short, ambiguous flashbacks that form the pieces to a greater puzzle. There's a certain degree of interactivity present that gives the viewer a stronger connection than had he or she just been explicitly lectured.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I can't think of very many other titles, save maybe for the cousin of Samurai Champloo, that have soundtracks as distinctly stylized as Cowboy Bebop's. Loyal to the name, jazz is the specific theme that composer Yoko Kanno intended for the series, and it's a theme that fits well. The spirit of expression, improvisation, passion, and divergence is indeed the character of Cowboy Bebop. Kanno masterfully utilized the tracks at fitting times throughout the series, greatly emphasizing the intended tone of a scene. One of the greatest analogies I can think of would be how well Susumu Hirasawa organized the abstract composition for Berserk ('97-98).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The voice acting, as is to be expected with such a critically acclaimed series, is fantastic. Cowboy Bebop is one of the few animes that can proudly say it has a dubbed version, so it is the viewers choice which version they'd like to hear. Personally, though this may conflict with most western enthusiasts, I prefer the Japanese voice actors.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Both the opening and ending tracks, "Tank!" and "The Real Folk Blues", respectively, are my all-time favorites. Kanno knew well how to begin and end the series, as the former gets you hyped up to all hell and the latter leaves you a pensive, emotional wreck. Ready yourself.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters
              <br/>
              <br/>
              If the world is the framework, the soundtrack the soul, and the animation the paint, Bebop's characters must be the muse. Cowboy Bebop is uniquely designed in that the story forms around the characters rather than the opposite. A certain amount of incredulity is eliminated when characters are written so well they speak as normal people. Watanabe didn't want to spin a tale, rather relay an epic of five adventurers.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              To that end, we don't see the crew as tools of a story, rather a group of friends that could be considered a family (albeit fairly dysfunctional). Spike is our flawed but lovable antihero, Jet his hardworking, moralistic foil. Faye the seductive femme fatale with a tendency for certain vices. Edward is our eccentric but useful hacker, and Ein the intelligent pupper. They're a ragtag bunch, but damn it, they work well together, and you grow to love them with each session.
              <br/>

              Enjoyment
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Needless to say, Cowboy Bebop was a wild ride. Session after sessions, my satisfaction never wavered. There's a certain richness to this series that gets you drunk off it, always lusting for another bounty.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Part of what made the show so fun for me was its westernized tone. While in Japan this may have been seen as foreign and intriguing, for those of us in the West, we see this as familiar and welcoming. Cowboys are kind of our thing, you know? Seeing a skillfully written Japanese perspective on what entails a "space cowboy" presents a fun experience for us western folk. It's funny how on both sides of the coin it can be a positive.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Conclusion
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The things that come to mind when I recall this anime come easily: cigarettes, smirks,  and woolongs. Funny how the slightest things can leave the biggest imprints, but that's exactly the intended effect. Be it the down-to-earth characters, comprehensive universe, or passionate scoring, the "new genre itself" Cowboy Bebop never leaves your heart. Even fifty-four years from now, no matter what new series are critically acclaimed, people will come back to and relive the experiences of that work with the same spark of excitement and adventure they once beared. We've all got a little space cowboy in us.

            "And the work which has become a genre upon itself is called: Cowboy Bebop." It's hard not to raise a skeptical eyebrow at the cocksure bravado displayed in the statement, and one might be tempted to proceed with the intent to smash this assertion, as well as the overwhelming praises this show has received, into pieces.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Except it was entirely justified.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Sure, Cowboy Bebop is actually a pastiche of genres heavily influenced by classic American films; spaghetti western, space road trip, gangland crime drama, buddy comedy, etc. But through amalgamation of these narrative elements, it has morphed into a unique creation with tremendous amount of
             <span id="review175501" style="display: none;">
              polish and flair, consisted of wildly varied bounty-of-the-week episodes and punctuated by  individual character arcs that end up becoming the series' highlights.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              What the show did with its characters are truly special. They started off as strangers to the audience and to each other (except for Spike and Jet, who are already acquainted in the beginning), only to gradually reveal fascinating layers of personality and history. There's no big drama or obvious bonding scenes between them, but as they bickered, cooperated, and told stories to each other, a subtle  bond is formed throughout the show and I couldn't help but be emotionally invested at their fates. It is through these characters, particularly in the different ways they react to their past demons (*a recurring motif), that the series got the substance to go along with its dazzling style. The writing of the show also made excellent use of symbolism and thematic delivery through subtle means; it's never distracting nor overly obtuse, and it's there to reward those actively looking to unravel more from the narrative.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Much has already been said about series director Shinichiro Watanabe, screenwiter Keiko Nobumoto, and composer Yoko Kanno, so I'm pretty much just preaching to the choir here, but I'll say it anyway:  this is one hell of a team, and we're lucky to have them in the anime industry. Th their vision, the world of Bebop is a rich, diverse,cornucopia of colorful characters set against the backdrop of sweet gorgeous music. I'm not a fan of jazz, and normally I don't even pay much attention to a show's given oST unless it's really exceptional or really terrible, but the composition and performance in this show is really something else. The Seatbelts, a multi-national and heavily instrumental band spearheaded by Kanno, contributed an incredible variety and quantity of stuff that became integral in setting the mood, whether it's the extremely iconic instrumental OP in Tank!, the gorgeous wordless vocal in ELM,  the haunting lyric of Call Me to accompany one of the most heart-breaking scenes in any anime, or the somber jazz piece of Space Lion, just to name a few examples from a (very) deep list.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I couldn't find it in me to give me a perfect score; my enjoyment of the stand-alone episodes are uneven, and the show never really sustained a sense of momentum until the final three episodes. I could also see someone watching this for the first time and find it to not really be that compelling, but it's important to note that Cowboy Bebop really became something special through repeat viewings, where one is more attuned to observe the homages, foreshadowing, and hidden nuggets of information in even the least consequential episode. Bottom line, if you're looking for something with serious entertainment and artistic merits, you owe it to yourself to watch this. Twice, at least.

            (This review contains spoilers)
            <br>
             <br/>
             The first few seconds of Cowboy Bebop are essentially a declaration of what the tone of the show is going to be, as well as a sign of what is at its core the nature of the series itself. ‘Asteroid Blues’ starts with this beautiful, soft music playing over the images of a lonely man dropping his last cigarette before giving up in waiting and leaving in the middle of the rain, but we don't even have time to take in this depressing atmosphere as it immediately kicks off one of the most badass opening songs of all time. And much like
             <span id="review320801" style="display: none;">
              the dichotomy between this introduction of Spike and the opening theme, 'Tank!' and 'The Real Folk Blues' (the ending song) create a similar one in every episode, the first being bombastically fun while the latter drags in a tragic melancholic feeling.
              <br/>
              The first episode itself resembles this same contrast. It is filled with goofy moments throughout, such as the boobs close-up shot at the bar or the moment when Spike takes that sandwich out of his mouth and offers it back to the woman, and it also features high quality, vibrant fight animation set to a fun, pulp score. But there’s room for more quiet, contemplative and even dark moments as well, since the 'villain’ of this episode is an insane, desperate man trying to reach an impossible future while his lover follows him in this path that will inevitably lead to their death. This is where we get the first parallel to Spike’s character, since he is willing to let them try to escape like he did with Julia three years ago, but in the end he is reminded of the cruel reality as the couple dies in one of the most silently tragic scenes in anime. The show is telling us how the story is doomed to conclude and it uses this moment to reflect it into the main characters, introducing the idea that they just need to move forward in order not to be consumed by the sadness surrounding them, though such experiences will inevitably get printed into their memories and become a part of the increasing weight of their past.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The episode opens up showing us Jet cooking a really poor dinner while Spike is exercising, as evidence of the fact that these people live day by day, doing anything it takes to keep going and not to think about it too much. The last scene of the episode appears somewhat similar, but this time Spike isn’t exercising, but standing at the vast space, wandering through his memories revived by the woman’s death. Then Jet comes and throws him a cigarette which he takes and smokes, which is significant because I think Spike’s unwillingness to move forward is represented through the act of smoking. In all these moments of contemplative sadness Spike sort of lays back and smokes, and once he is finished he throws the cigarette to the ground and steps on it as if he was quitting, yet he always ends up taking another one anyways. It feels like he is saying to himself 'let’s take a final taste of the past’, but he knows he’s trapped in a cycle that will never end. I think there are two clear indications of this. The first comes in the very first scene of the show, when Spike throws a cigarette while leaving Julia behind, but this idea is presented in clearer terms throughout the series, in particular during a scene from episode 21 that I’ll discuss once we get there.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Making a parallel with the previously mentioned contrast in the first seconds of Bebop’s introduction, if episode 1 would for the most part be the equivalent of the quite scene of Spike leaving in the rain, then episodes 2, 3 and 4 pretty much feel like the opening song, until the point that one could easily think at this point that the show would just be a fun adventure for its entire run, at least until episode 5 came as a reminder of the subtext of the series once again. However, that previous belief is not necessarily missguided, in fact it is kind of the point. These episodes are part of the heart and soul of Cowboy Bebop as much as any of the more dramatic or plot-centric ones, because life itself is built around two sides of the same coin. But we’re not ready to explore this topic yet. For now I’ll just say that Faye's introduction scene in episode 3 is the most badass thing I’ve ever seen (Megumi Hayashibara is perfect on her role, as well as everyone else in the cast) and Ein is a cool smart dog that only gets cuter as the show progresses, especially after Ed’s entrance.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ‘Ballad of Fallen Angels’ is a weird episode to talk about, since its purpose is no other than to simply present Spike’s backstory, but it is the way that it does so that makes it so iconic and a truly legendary episode in anime history.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop could easily be considered one of the best-looking anime of all time, and not because it does anything the best, but because it is brilliant in every single aspect of its production and also consistent in its presentation in every single episode. The background art for instance, while not in the realm of Revolutionary Girl Utena or Berserk, is nonetheless highly impressive, especially when it comes to the old-fashioned, dirty urban locations brought to life through intricate details and the melancholically beautiful sunsets whose excellent color choices perfectly convey the feeling they’re meant to evoke in the viewer.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The character designs are lively, distinctive and full of personality, yet also surprisingly detailed and complex since the show is constantly producing high-quality animation and almost every single drawing of them is on point, their expressions and postures usually adding to their attitude and mood, spelling out what words cannot communicate. The mechanical designs are also fantastic and creative, the spaceships being truly unique and also depicting the characters’ personalities and different ways of moving. For example, while Spike’s ship is fast, agile and aggressive, Jet’s is slow and heavy, but it also uses a crane with multiple applications, resembling his old days as a policeman and his nickname ‘Black Dog’.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              CGI is obviously the only aspect of the show that is dated. However, it looks far from terrible and its use is fairly limited, never outputting the viewer. Part of this is because of the previously mentioned phenomenal mechanical designs, as it is mostly used for depicting space structures (such as the hyperspace portal) and the different planets. The little Ed internet navigations have a cheesy, fun edge to them as well, so overall I can completely overlook what is probably the single relatively significant flaw of the show’s production, and one attached to the time it was created.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Shinichiro Watanabe’s genius as a director comes from his ability to combine all these separate elements in order to create a cohesive package which mainly shines due to a brilliant sense of flow which perfectly crafts the more exciting and action-driven moments with the quiet, contemplative ones, and also from his deep understanding when it comes to knowing exactly where to place the camera and the characters within it to convey a sense of pacing, powerful emotions or subtly invite viewers to think about the implications of what they just saw.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Travelling to another side of anime production, I could talk about the music in this show until the end of times, but let’s just put it this way. Cowboy Bebop has the best soundtrack in any piece of media, and it’s not only because of Yoko Kanno’s god-tier compositions and the incredibly diverse styles they display and the great range of emotions they evoke (my personal favourites probably being ‘Waltz for Zizi’ and ‘Call Me Call Me’), but also because of how perfectly they complement the visuals. For example, ‘Tank!’ is a joy not only because of Kanno’s magnificent piece but especially because of how the images match it perfectly until the point that listening to just the music makes it feel empty in a way. The cinematography and timing of every single second of it perfectly captures the classic cool feel of the song, and even the credits are crafted into the visuals in such a natural way that they elevate instead of limiting the image in a level of artistry I’ve only seen achieved elsewhere in Puzzle, Welcome to the NHK!'s opening song. In the show itself, it feels like Kanno and Watanabe worked side by side considering how to complement every image with each song and vice versa, from the desertic-feeling riffs played by Tsuneo Imahori in episode 19 to the jazzy music that enhances Spike’s playful nature in his fight in episode 1 (Toshihiro Kawamoto, character designer and animation director for the series, explained in fact in a relatively recent interview how the composer's work inspired him and the staff to create new scenarios and situation where the characters could act and interact). I would also like to highlight the use of silence, since I am of the opinion that it is sound as well, and scenes like the one at the end of ‘Asteroid Blues’ are proof of how effective its proper application can be.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I touch into all this because session 5 and especially the entire cathedral scene is the culmination of Bebop’s audiovisual splendor, and without all the elements of the production working together the intentions the show was going for would have not been properly communicated and it would have remained as a simple, kind of vague backstory episode. The initial sequence already features some masterful combination of quick editing and gripping sound design that gives Vicious a mysterious, unsettling and almost ethereal presence. Thematically, this episode introduces in clear terms the idea of Spike’s attachment to his past, as he immediately jumps off the Bebop when he hears the news of Mao’s death. This is also the first moment of the series when a character jumps into danger or an insecure situation while the rest of the crew complains about it, a trend that will result in some of the most heartbreaking scenes of the show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As I said, I see the cathedral scene as the pinnacle of what Bebop’s audiovisual presentation is capable of. We see Spike approaching the building, passing by a gorgeously detailed background whose color pallet conveys the more obscure and tragic tone of this episode. ‘Rain’ fits perfectly not only the atmosphere but the thematic resonance of the scene as well, as it plays like a distant eco during Spike’s walk to the cathedral, like memories playing in the back of his mind. The atmosphere created through clever use of lighting inside the cathedral itself is excellent, and the animation of the shooting between Spike and the members of the Syndicate highly impressive, even allowing for a glorious gag featuring Faye’s boobs bouncing for less than a brief second, a quick reminder of the fact that this is still Cowboy Bebop.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Finally, let’s get into the famous ‘Green Bird’ scene. It manages to be one of the most iconic moments in anime history thanks to combining brilliant editing with a song which seems to transcend the limitations of time and space, matching brilliantly with the images of Spike’s backstory. As he falls from the window, Spike visualizes his memories of his friendship with Vicious and his romance with Julia, and how both situations ended up in a conflict that brought an end to the most significant period in the cowboy's life. Most of these images are actually depicted on ‘The Real Folk Blues’, giving the ending song much more gravitude for the viewer from this episode on. The use of broken pieces of glass falling alongside Spike is equally important, as it subtly introduces one of Bebop’s central themes, the idea that we are defined by our past. All these pieces, all these memories are a part of him, and together they form who Spike is, his identity (more on that later).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It's the ability of director Shinichiro Watanabe to figure out how to present the story of a character in such an unconventional yet still effective way and to portray the true significance of said story what makes all of them so memorable and special, and also why ‘Ballad of Fallen Angels’ might just be the single best episode in the series.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ‘Sympathy for the Devil’ is one of the most important episodes of Cowboy Bebop, since it probably presents Spike’s attachment to his past in the cleanest terms, and therefore reassures his inevitable destiny. The ‘villain’ featuring episode 6 is an immortal man whose body hasn’t grown up since he was a kid due to the accident of the hyperspace portal that occurred fifty years ago. This allows me to introduce another element of Bebop’s storytelling artistry, its worldbuilding. Much like with the characters’ backstories, no one ever sits and explains the entire story of how this post apocalyptic world came to be, instead it is through these details naturally implemented into the narrative that we get the pieces of what I perceive as a puzzle whose image becomes clearer as the series progresses. To put another example of this, in Faye’s backstory it is mentioned that her data was lost because of the hyperspace accident, making the viewers think about the enormous consequences of this galaxy-shattering event, which reached even severe logistic issues.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Going back to ‘Sympathy for the Devil’, what stands out the most about it is its final scene. Zebra’s immortality and childish appearance represent his unwillingness to move from the past, an idea depicted through the harmonica he used to play as a kid and during the accident and stills carries and plays as a way of keeping those memories alive (see the parallel with Spike's cigarettes?). Once Spike fires Zebra and he starts becoming old and dying, he tells Spike that he feels relieved and that our dear space cowboy understands what he means by this. Spike then takes the harmonica and says ‘I get it’, throws it into the air, points his finger to it forming a gun and says ‘Bang’. What Zebra means is that death is the only way out from the weight of his memories, and what Spike gets is that if he doesn’t move forward he is going to follow that same path and eventually reach the same conclusion. He says ‘Bang’, but he doesn’t actually shoot the harmonica. He could do it, he could take his gun and do it, but he doesn’t, just like he doesn’t stop smoking. He cannot put his past aside.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              To be honest, ‘Heavy Metal Queen’ is the only episode I find skippable in the entire series. Don’t get me wrong, it is thoroughly entertaining and it is still a Cowboy Bebop episode, meaning that the characters and their interactions are way more fun and interesting than almost any others in anime, but it doesn’t really add anything to the show thematically and it is not as fun as most of the other light-hearted adventures. However, there are a couple of things I find worth mentioning. First of all, we get an interesting piece of worldbuilding as they go to a factory in space, which would be the coolest concept ever if a space casino hadn’t been the main scenario of ‘Honky Tonk Women’. Furthermore, the dynamic between Spike and VT is greatly and subtly realised, especially on their first encounter, because even if they don’t know anything about each other they get along perfectly fine since they both have been shaped by the loss of someone very close to them and seem to share a similar worldview.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Episode 8 might not carry the emotional weight of the cream of the series, but I find its tragedy pretty significant in Bebop’s overall tone and narrative. It introduces a new character who asks Spike to teach him his martial arts’ abilities. The explanation Spike gives him is actually really interesting, even if it follows the traditional eastern mystical speech we all know. Spike talks about energy as a flowing river, and this presents a new layer on his character that gets developed throughout the show, the fact that he accepts things as they come, even his own death, an idea perfectly conveyed in the phrase ‘Whatever happens, happens’ from episode 19, ‘Wild Horses’. This could very easily be a commentary on the Japanese defeatist mentality towards the end of the world, Spike representing the attitude that is common to the old-fashioned, post-apocalyptic world of Bebop and which parallels that of the millennial country while Ed and the other kids in the series exemplify the intentions of young generations to change this mentality and try to move forward towards the future.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Speaking about the tragedy I briefly touched on at the beginning of the previous paragraph, this episode makes clear that the flowing river Spike is following is a tragic one. The death of his ‘pupil’ resembles that of Julia in the last episode, almost seeming like destiny itself is drawing attention to the fact that Spike will never be happy. The scene at the hospital with the blind sister does nothing but enhance the tragedy, one that Spike moves away from before the show reminds us once again that in the end he can’t with that astonishingly beautiful sequence that closes the episode.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ‘Jamming with Edward’ serves as the introduction for the last member of the main cast, the infinitely lovable Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV (let’s leave it as Ed). Ed is essential for Bebop’s narrative, mainly because she is the only kid among a cast of grown-up adults, and the dichotomy between the entirely different perspectives on the world and towards any situations they inevitably have because of their age difference makes not only for hilarious interactions, but for some of the most subtly emotional scenes in the series as well. What makes episode 9 so fun to watch is that Ed is so over the top that she can easily handle what is already a wacky and crazy group, making them seem like a bunch of boring greybeards.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This episode also tackles on the subject of the past, since this time the bounty is a satellite which (or may I say ‘who’?) drew symbols with its laser on the Earth’s surface to remember the time when it could see the original human planet full of life and people. It is one of the most simple stories within the show, but it is nonetheless pretty touching and it throws some questions about how alive can something be if moved by such desire, even if it is a machine.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ‘Ganymede Elegy’ is the first episode focusing entirely on Jet, so let’s take a minute to discuss his character. Jet could be described as the father figure in this bizarre family. He is the voice of reason and the owner of the Bebop, though despite of being usually overwhelmed by the crazy attitude of the others and always complaining about them doing whatever they want and saying he doesn’t care, he's actually the one who has the hardest time dealing with it, and he himself will jump off the ship to reconcile with his past twice in the show. The progression of his relationship with Faye is brilliant and probably the strongest among the cast, and it is really sad to see Jet act like the cutest of tsundere whenever she abandons the ship. Jet’s appearance is towering and at some points he even looks like a pretty dangerous and cruel person, my favourite example of this being his facial expression when he forces the gangsters at the bar in episode 1 to tell him what they know, but he also reveals himself to be fragile when dealing with others and especially with his own emotions.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This episode features some pretty obvious metaphors, particularly Jet’s broken watch, representing how his unwillingness to leave the past behind has made time stop for him, an attitude his former wife criticizes at some point in the episode. However, I think the last shot of ‘Ganymede Elegy’ can be interpreted in different ways. Jet throws his watch to the water, like if he was abandoning his past, but it stands out to me the fact that the watch is still broken, time isn’t moving anyways. I personally interpret from this shot that Jet, as we will see in ‘Black Dog Serenade’, hasn’t really moved on, but I could perfectly understand other people thinking the exact opposite and seeing it as the first step for creating a situation in the last two episodes in which Spike is the only one among the crew who’s still attached to his past (again, I don't interpret the show this way at all, but I could accept other people doing so).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The reason his wife left him behind is also pretty relevant to Jet’s character. She felt like she didn’t have control over her own life since Jet was always taking the right decisions for both, this piece of information allowing us to understand why Jet gets so mad whenever Spike or Faye do whatever they want without asking for any approval or even thinking about the consequences, and the fact that her wife never came back explains his fear towards any member of the Bebop leaving the stage. However, from this point forward Jet begins to understand that he needs to let people make their own decisions, even if missguided, one of the reasons why he doesn’t try to stop Spike from going to face Vicious in episode 26.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ‘Toys in the Attic’ is truly representative of one of the defining characteristics of Cowboy Bebop and what makes it so iconic, infinitely re-watchable and broadly appealing on a level the vast majority of anime cannot achieve, the fact that it borrows influences from so many places, gives them what I like to call a ‘Bebop twist’ and combines them to create a completely unique feel for the series. As it is put in the text shown in the opening’s background itself: ‘The work, which becomes a new genre itself, will be called… Cowboy Bebop’. This also makes the dominance of Jazz in Bebop’s soundtrack thematically relevant, since as said in the op’s text as well this idea of combining different genres to create a new one was inspired by a group of young jazzmen playing in Harlem’s ‘Minton’s Playhouse’ club circa 1941 who got tired of the conventional fixed jazz style and eager to play jazz more freely. I can see a commentary here on how fixed anime is on its meta, a problem voices like Hideaki Anno (director of Neon Genesis Evangelion) usually point out while stating the medium's need to seek for external influences in order to enrich itself and evolve.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Episode 11 is a parody of Ridley Scott’s 1979 classic, Alien, yet it manages to be legitimately unsettling thanks to brilliant directing and sound design while at the same time utterly hilarious because the people facing this situation are no other than the Bebop crew. In the end Ed eats the alien, which happened to be an evolved food which had spent over a year in the fridge, because who the fuck cares. Another reference to classic sci-fi cinema is the satellite from episode 9, obviously paralleling ‘Hal’ from Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece, 2001: An Space Odyssey. Episode 22, ‘Cowboy Funk’, is an homage to Sergio Leone’s spaghetti western, but set in Bebop’s sci-fi scenario to hilarious results, and episode 17, ‘Mushroom Samba’, resembles 70’s blaxploitation (to mention just a few).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Episodes 12 and 13, ‘Jupiter Jazz’, serve as a sort of intermission or middle point in the series. It almost feels like a prologue or even an alternative version of ‘The Real Folk Blues’, and it presents the most direct parallel to Spike’s conclusion. Gren’s relationship with Vicious, even if not romantic per se (though some people could interpret it as such), resembles that of Spike and Julia, since he knows he will die when confronting his former friend even though he was betrayed by him in the past. The final scene is exactly like the last one from episode 26, but there is a more subtle parallel I find even more interesting. I’m talking about Faye’s role in both stories.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Faye is introduced in episodes 3 and 4, ‘Honky Tonk Woman’ and ‘Gateway Shuffle’. She is presented as this strong female figure wandering through space and trying to deal with her problems through her own resources and somewhat questionable methods. However, throughout her journey in the Bebop she begins to develop a sense of belonging, but because of not yet revealed circumstances she is afraid of such feelings as she fears losing it once again, running from the spaceship when this fear emerges to the surface of her mind.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Once she meets Gren they get along pretty well, quickly developing a relationship as Faye reveals herself to be a deeply flawed character, a lost woman who doesn’t know where to go, what to do or how to deal with her feelings. She finds out that Gren is going to meet Vicious and begs him to stay, but just like Spike in episode 26 he ends up facing his past anyways, leaving Faye with a new scar printed into her memories.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ is a pretty interesting episode that introduces the idea that being able to forget or leave the past behind is a victory. The bounty for this episode is an insanely old man who has been preparing this intricate plan for fifty years in order to get revenge, but once our protagonists meet him he’s just an ancient relic whose attitude resembles that of a child and who enjoys the few days he has left doing what he’s passionate about, playing chess. He has forgotten his past, and the series presents this fact as something good, since succeeding in his revenge wouldn’t bring this lonely individual any more happiness than the one he’s having by just enjoying his remaining days. It is also really sweet to see Jet demand the company nothing else but leaving the man alone just so Ed can keep playing chest with him, a sign of the increasing comradery among the cast.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I talked about how ‘Jupiter Jazz’ felt like a middle point in the show, and that’s because I think from here until pretty much episode 24 the series focuses more heavily on developing the relationships between Bebop’s members through both fun, light-hearted episodes with a similar vibe to them than the ones from the first half (‘Bohemian Rhapsody’, for instance) and especially sessions focusing directly (and not just paralleling or commenting on) on the cast’s different backstories, which expand and enrich the central theme of the series. Taking out of the count both ‘Jupiter Jazz’ and ‘The Real Folk Blues’, there are four of these backstory episodes in the second half of the show, while among the first thirteen episodes only two, so I think I get my point across.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ‘My Funny Valentine’ finally introduces Faye’s past, or it would be better to say the lack of thereof. This episode is presented as a typical romance story at first, but just like Spike and Jet comically say at the ‘next episode preview’ (by the way, you should check all of them out at the very end of every episode, they are absolutely great), it was a complete lie. However, I think there’s something more going on here other than simply a joke, as we can see Faye in a vulnerable position we never got the chance to witness before through this sort of princess tale for little girls. It comes off to me from her little ‘love story’ with Matsumoto that Faye is just looking for a shoulder to rely on, this not necessarily meaning a love interest but simply a place she can feel comfortable in and live among other people whom she cares about and respects. That’s why I think Faye and Spike’s relationship never appears to me as romantic, but as a sincere friendship born out of mutual respect and the enjoyment of each other’s company, as well as the fact that both understand the other perfectly because of their similar wandering nature.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The other point of interest in this episode is Faye’s mysterious past, not so much because of the show succeeding at making us viewers curious about it, but because the fact that Faye is constantly realising how every single thing she thought she knew about herself and others is a lie helps us understand her previous actions and contradictory attitude during the first half of the show, progressively getting closer to the Bebop and then rejecting these connections because of her fear of losing them again. In the end, this isn’t necessarily one of the best episodes of the series, yet it establishes crucial characterization in order to create one of them later on, and it truly is one of the funniest.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              There is a moment in ‘Black Dog Serenade’ when Jet asks Ed to irrigate his bonsai if he doesn’t come back, and Ed just starts jumping and goofing around as usual. This little interaction is the first moment in Cowboy Bebop that truly made me want to cry. Ed doesn’t understand what not coming back really means, she doesn’t know what it is not to see someone you care about ever again, and it’s this dichotomy between a jaded old man and an innocent child that makes it such a compelling scene. It’s also now that we understand how important Jet is not only for each individual member of the Bebop, but for keeping all of our cowboys together as well.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This episode contains what I think is the moment that better encapsulates the central theme of Cowboy Bebop, which you could easily tell from some of the previous paragraphs but I’m just going to spell it out at the end of this one. Despite all the things Jet and Fad went through, including the latter’s betrayal to Jet, neither can’t help to care for one another after all those years of friendship and camaraderie, so Fad doesn’t shoot in the end as a way of redemption for his sins. Jet stands in front of the friend he just killed, looking completely devastated. Then he stands up and starts walking, seemingly in the attempt of moving forward and not letting this event destroy him. Jet’s walking is slow and difficult because of his harmed leg, but something about this scene comes off to me as if Fad’s dead figure was what was actually dragging him. And I think this beautifully conveys what the central theme of this series is, the weight of the past. None of the characters can escape their memories, no matter how hard they try. They'll do anything in a worthless attempt to move on with their lives, but the true tragedy comes when they form new connections that will inevitably break once their past calls them once more, leaving at the same time the people they formed those new connections with a bigger weight on their own memories. But I'm getting ahead of myself.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ‘Mushroom Samba’ is the perfect Cowboy Bebop episode in a way. It is a joy to watch Ed and Ein going on an adventure set in the middle of a blaxploitation film and to see how they use the grown-up members of the cast for their little experiment, all of them interacting in their own unique ways with hilarious results. However, there’s also room for subtle character moments via the mushroom hallucinations. Spike’s is a ladder that obviously represents his path to death, one he keeps climbing in spite of being warned about what is waiting at the top. Faye finds herself in the middle of the ocean, wandering through a vast world of emptiness, and Jet’s lonely conversation makes him seem like a man trying to chat with old friends who are all long gone.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ‘Speak Like a Child’ introduces yet another crucial narrative point of the show and one that heavily enriches its central theme. It features some really cool worldbuilding beats and the whole scene of Spike and Jet trying to get the VHS player is outright hilarious, but it is its conclusion that carries the emotional weight of the episode. Watching the videotape is heartbreaking. It shows Faye in her teens sending a message to herself in the future, and it has this moment where little Faye starts cheering her future self, one who breaks down in tears because in spite of being the same individual she's completely disconnected to the girl on screen. I think the show is sending a clear message here, the idea that no matter how harmful it might be, we need a past. Our past defines us, it gives us a sense of belonging and we can use it as a reference to decide whether to try and go back to it or to move forward. The tragedy of Faye’s character is that she doesn’t have past memories, so she cannot get a sense of who she is nor understand what she wants or where to go. She is creating a new present and a place to live in among the Bebop crew, but when she finally realises about this fact it’s already too late.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Episodes 19 and 20 comment heavily on Spike’s attitude towards his past and his life in general. The first one, ‘Wild Horses’, presents Spike’s previously mentioned notion of destiny and his worldview as a flowing river from which no person can escape. Once again, this is perfectly exemplified by his phrase ‘Whatever happens, happens’, which he says before almost dying twice in this episode.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ‘Pierrot le Fou’ nearly feels like a horror piece, barely featuring any jokes or classic ‘Bebop moments’. Tongpu is a terrifying man with the mind of a child, but he is ultimately afraid of Spike’s eyes because those show the strong determination he has of facing his past, something Tongpu can’t deal with and runs away from through his dreamlike fantasy. That’s why Spike has to face him again, in order to prove that such approach to life is wrong. The thematic relevance of Tongpu’s death by being smashed in the ground by his own ‘toys’ is something we’ll talk about when commenting on episode 24, but I’m afraid I want to tackle some complaints I have with this session before we continue.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              What makes their first encounter so terrifying is that it is completely unexpected and we don’t know what this crazy man’s deal is. As I said, this episode feels like a horror piece, and the dark atmosphere truly conveys how dangerous and out of place Tongpu is. That’s why I think anything else in this episode that is not Spike and Tongpu’s fight is completely worthless and it even overshadows their confrontation. We get a full explanation of who Tongpu is, and this not only breaks the previously mentioned atmosphere but also the mystery surrounding this man’s figure, which was a crucial aspect of what made him so threatening. The most frustrating thing about this is the fact that we get all the information we needed from Tongpu through a couple of silent flashbacks which fit perfectly with the tone of the episode.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              However, I understand that this is the result of TV schedule limitations, since the episode needed to be 24 minutes long and they needed to fill the remaining time with something somewhat related to the rest of it, and the fight was already really long and featured constant high-quality animation with tons of difficult camera perspectives and movements, making it impossible to keep it engaging and at such bar for the entire 20 minutes run. Personally, I would have gone for some random Ed adventure which would fit with the series' irreverent attitude. Overall, this is just me complaining because a great episode wasn’t perfect, but this is the only session that severely suffers from pacing issues, pretty much all the others being tight, dense and never letting you feel like they’re wasting any of your time, so I felt like it was significant to point it out.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I briefly mentioned episode 21 when commenting on the cigarette symbolism at the beginning of this analysis, but ‘Boogie-Woogie Feng Shui’ is also interesting because of its thematic connection with episode 24 and, just like episode 23 as we will discuss, because of how it builds up the implications of Ed’s departure. Meifa is one the few characters in Cowboy Bebop that ultimately manages to deal with her past in a healthy way, because she overcomes her father’s death in the end and she’s able to look up for a new purpose in life, which is exactly what Jet wanted. There’s this scene when Spike and Faye are smoking next to her and she starts coughing, so Jet tells them to go smoke outside. To me this is the definitive proof that smoking is how the show symbolizes the characters’ attachment to their past. Jet is a jaded old man, but he trusts in future generations and doesn’t want them to be consumed by their memories, being this the reason why he metaphorically protects Meifa from that feeling. He himself desperately wants to move forward, but the weight of his past is already too heavy. However, he wants to help others to do what he is already incapable of, even if he will finally accept Spike’s resolution in the end (and mainly because Spike is unable to change at this point either).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Episode 23 is a clear commentary on television and how it has become society’s new God, amplifying the already insane number of genres and concepts introduced in the series. It is particularly interesting to see this one since the show aired in 1998, the same year as Serial Experiments Lain and Perfect Blue, both being stories which develop similar themes as I commented in my review on the latter (Lain focuses its narrative on the building of a new personality in the internet while Perfect Blue delivers its message through its commentary on perceiving media as reality).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              However, the line from this episode that stood out to me is 'God didn’t create humans, it was humans who created God’, and not because of the obvious philosophical quote everybody knows, but because of what it is really implying. Throughout the show there's this sort of spiritual undercurrent hiding in the background. For example, in episode 2 a man accurately predicts Hakim’s future when looking for Ein, or in episode 1 Spike gets a prophecy about his encounter with the couple. There’s so many others, but the idea surrounding them all is destiny, meaning that Spike will inevitably die because of running after his past. However, this previously mentioned line seems to affect Spike profoundly, and I think it’s because what it is really saying is that ultimately he is the one who decides to take that path. In other words, he creates his God, not the opposite.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Spike calls out the childish attitude of the kid starring this episode, as he is trying to avoid reality and looking forward to creating a perfect world where essentially everyone leaves their past behind, yet unlike Spike Ed seems pretty compelled by this. She is a child as well, and according to how the events will play out in the last three episodes it is implied that such way of thinking may be not only appropriate, at least on some level, but also the only one which truly allows for achieving a comfortable place in this universe. Once again, I can clearly interpret Bebop’s narrative through these episodes as a clash between the classic Japanese defeatist mindset represented by the adults and the modern philosophy carried by the newer generations, though in my opinion this is just a supplement for the series’ true significance, in which we are finally going to dive into while commenting its last three episodes.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ‘Hard Luck Woman’ is one of, if not the emotional peak of the series. On the one hand, Faye is finally able to remember her past after meeting an old friend (here we get the only plot hole I could find in the whole series, the doctor said that he gave Faye her name yet this old lady recognises her by that same name). However, once she gets to the top of the hill she used to live in she realises that such past no longer exists, and then Faye is confronted again with the fact that she doesn’t have any place to belong in this universe, her loneliness extremely well conveyed on that beautiful shot where she lays on the ground surrounded by the desertic ruins her memories have become.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              On the other hand, Ed finds her father after seven years, he being more crazy and wild than his own child. Ed realises that she needs to find her own place on this universe, so she is able to leave the Bebop behind and move forward towards the future she wants to achieve (yes, you could assume she’s running after her past as well, and in a way she is, but I think she ultimately goes in sort of a quest for self-discovering). The difference between her and Tongpu is that he chose to live a fantasy in order to avoid his past and is ultimately destroyed by his own madness as symbolized in his death scene, while Ed will not forget the crew, but it is her determination of not letting herself be dragged by her past what in the end turns her story into the only truly happy or uplifting one among the cast.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              After her departure, we get this incredible scene of Spike and Jet sitting in the living room and eating eggs like crazy, because what else are they gonna do, stand there and cry? As we discussed when talking about ‘Asteroid Blues’, they can’t afford that. They need to do whatever it takes to keep going with their lives or else they’ll be emotionally destroyed. However, this time is clearly not working, no matter how fast and viciously they eat. As anime YouTuber Digibro says on his video 'You're Gonna Carry That Weight' (which, by the way, I highly recommend), this scene comes off as a desperate attempt for Spike and Jet to move on, but because of the strong bond they've come to form with Ed they can't just put this feeling aside as they've done with so many of the tragic episodic events of the series. So, with the crew starting to grow apart, it's finally time for the continuously foreshadowed and inevitable conclusion.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Faye’s encounter with Julia in ‘The Real Folk Blues Part 1’ feels like a silent fight between the two most badass women in the universe for the life and soul of the most badass man. However, what makes this confrontation so sad is that Julia had already won before it even started, she always won from the beginning, and Faye realises as soon as she sees Spike’s reaction when he hears her name later on. After they try to run away in ‘The Real Folk Blues Part 2’, Julia’s death reminds Spike that this was all a dream, an illusion, just like it was for that couple in episode 1. One might think that now there’s nothing attaching him to his past anymore, but it never really was about Julia nor Vicious, what Spike can’t put aside is the concept of past itself, and therefore he finally faces his inevitable destiny.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The tragedy of Spike’s final departure is that neither Jet or Faye can stop him even if they want to, because they understand Spike better than anyone else, they would in fact do the same thing if they had the chance to come to terms with their past once more. They all share the same inherent, eager need to go back, and no matter how hard they try to form a family, they always knew this fact would eventually tear them apart. Faye could shoot him in the leg, but she raises her hand instead and fires to the ceiling out of sheer frustration as her friend abandons the Bebop for the last time. Now Spike has become a new scar of her past, and the prospect of forming a sense of belonging is once again lost.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop has shown us that life can be fun and exciting, that it can be worth living, but also that every single moment of happiness will inevitably bring one of sadness that we’ll have to deal with eventually. That’s why I said at the start that the contrast in the show’s tone and presentation was so crucial to its final message, expressed from the very beginning with the opening scene and the opening song and during the entire show through the sometimes lighthearted and fun, sometimes dark and depressing episodes and even the shift in tone inside the sessions themselves.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Life is about going on adventures, running after a dog, going to a space casino, fighting an alien, playing chess, wandering through the desert looking for food, exploring old ruins to get a VHS player or play cowboys, but it is also about being betrayed by someone you wouldn’t expect that from, wandering through space without any clear purpose, listening to a friend saying goodbye for the last time without realising that it is in fact the last time, seeing people you care about following their own paths that take them apart from you or laughing alongside someone you know is going to die.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In the final scene of the show, Spike points his finger directly to you. Now it is up to you to decide how to deal with the impact that these characters and their stories have left in you, with the fact that they have shaped you and that they are now part of the weight of your past. And it might be painful, but I’m proudly gonna carry that weight.

            Alright, my first review here so let's get right into it.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Cowboy bebop, where do I even begin... For me, this anime was a rollercoaster of  ride. At the beginning I enjoyed getting to know all these characters and how they slowly become a part of each others lives. But around the 7th episode, I couldn't keep watching it. I asked my friends who had watched this show whether this will ever get interesting, in the sense, whether there is a bigger story that all this is leading up to or whether this is just an episodic anime series, which by the way I
             <span id="review377449" style="display: none;">
              don't like. They couldn't give me a straight answer and now I understand why.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              If you're seeing this review and you're someone who doesn't enjoy episodic series, then pay heed to my advice and watch Cowboy Bebop. No matter how it may seem, there is a bigger story in this anime. I was bored to death till around the 13th episode, but then I started paying attention to details. Every episode has some or the other reference to the characters' pasts. Sometimes it's subtle, sometimes it's blatant, but it's present. Things get interesting somewhere around the 20th episode (Also this depends on the person. For me it was interesting from the 20th episode, for someone else, it may be before that or after that) and everything starts to fall into place in the final 3-4 episodes.  I liked the story that cowboy bebop was trying to tell, it was... how do I describe it... Philosophical. I won't speak more, but all I say is WATCH THE SHOW.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              After seeing me write so many positive things about the show, you might be wondering why I have given it an 8. Let me justify my rating here.
              <br/>
              I liked the ending, I really did, but it's those 7-8 episodes in the first half of the show for me. Don't get me wrong, they weren't extremely bad, but I found them really boring. I slept halfway through one of the episodes too. If it weren't for the ending being so good, I would have probably rated this a 5 or possibly even a 4 because like I said, I don't enjoy episodic anime series. But Cowboy Bebop is much more than that, and I think majority of the people here won't find the first half of the show boring because some of the stories in the episodes are really compelling and you won't even realize how time passes by.

            Writing mini reviews or my initial reactions to each episode and stating my overall opinion of the show as I watch it for the first time.  The end will have a full score.  I haven't done this type of thing before, so bear with me.  Watching this Dubbed BTW.
            <br>
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Sessions 1&amp;2:  The intro is amazing, but what's up with the voice acting?  Other than that, it's just alright.  What's with the hype though?  4/10
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Session 3: The art style is actually really nice actually.  5/10
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Session 4:  The voice acting is getting better, and I actually see hints of
             <span id="review296203" style="display: none;">
              something great. 6/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 5: I can't do this episode justice.  The whole episode is amazing, giving a backstory and some new information.  The art here is amazing, but by far the best part is the music.  I had no idea Green Bird was from Cowboy Bebop.  Explains why the rest of the music is so amazing.  9/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 6: This keeps up the quality established in session 5.  Interesting premise, and satisfying conclusion.  9/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 7:  This episode is pleasantly interesting.  The music and comedy are great, and the characters are too.  You get a bit more information on the characters, and it's nice to see a show which gets space right for once!  9/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 8:  Did... Did they actually get paid for once? 10/10!!  But really, this is another great episode.  Even the side characters are multifaceted, not to mention Spike.  9/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 9: 2001 reference in the hostile AI?  Who is this annoying kid?  Why does Earth look so weird?  Oh so the kid is a hacker, alright.  The music at 12:35 is great.  Oh shit the kid's a recurring character.  At least it seems that the music will return.  9/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 10:  It was great to learn about Jet and his past.  I'm liking the characters more and more as the show goes on.  9/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 11:  This episode seems to play with genres in a really fluid way.  Impressive.  9/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 12:  It's a little thing, but I enjoy how locations in this series are generally accurate, not including obvious changes for science fiction's sake.  I'm beginning to really like the story here too.  9/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 13:  Part 2... Interesting.  Everything about this 2-Parter is insane.  I'm starting to understand the hype around this show now.  10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 14:  Shit she's not dead.  This episode seems pretty normal, so I want to use this time to mention how amazing the setting is.  The technology seems actually reasonably accurate for 2071.  Intrasolar-system travel in large, bulky ships.  The warp gates are the only thing which seems outlandish, but otherwise most everything makes sense.  10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 15:  Ein is the best character.  Oh look a Faye backstory.  54 years, 20, 2071... Huh.  So we know lots about Faye, enough to be completely confused about Spike, and nothing about Jet.  10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 16:  Jet episode!  Jetisode!  11/10!
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 17:  Oh no an Ed episode.  I hope he dies in that desert.  Shrooms.  Actually I think I like Ed, I can't tell if she's a genius or an idiot though.  10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 18:  This entire episode is enjoyable simply for the fact that something which originally released while VHS was dominant has an episode about how antiquated it is.  (Technically a Betamax I know) 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 19:  Another interesting episode.  I love seeing the old tech again!  10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 20:  Balloon man?  This episode seems almost like a horror premise.  What the hell is happening here? 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 21:  Another episode about Jet?  Use it on Gloom!  They haven't really done anything They haven't really done anything special since Jupiter Jazz, so I'm not sure if I can still give it a ten.  9/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 22:  Yeah this episode could only have been made before 2001.  Oh shit he's voiced by Mr. Turner, he's definitely an idiot.  This was an entertaining episode.  9/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 23:  The Satire in this episode's beginning is greohh is that Faye?  NO NOT BIG SHOT!  Oh shit it's Heaven's Gate isn't it!  Applewhite = Banana?  Oh this is highly relevant to today, interesting.  This episode was really self aware, and seemingly timeless in influences.  This is another favorite episode for me I think.  9/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 24:  This episode has so much character development with only 2 episodes left.  This is another great episode.  The music is used particularly well here too.  This episode's ending is really bittersweet, but in a great way not many shows can achieve.  10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Session 25&amp;26:  There's only a short time left, so of course this will get real interesting.  The past is catching up to everybody, it seems.  A killer ending.  I have NEVER seen a better ending to an anime, show, or movie.  This ending is ambiguous, which is only fitting for a show which so nearly mirrors and satirizes life.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It took 6 years, but a show has finally supplanted Scientific Railgun as my favorite anime.  The soundtrack, the characters, the art, the storytelling, everything.  I have found shows which equal it in nearly every category:  Nichijou in art, Initial D in soundtrack, various shows in storytelling, but nothing has ever combined it all into one like this.  I started the show expecting to dislike it.  It's just how I always go into popular shows.  I cannot fully do this show justice.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I usually feel upset when a show ends.  I feel a sort of emptiness, a "well now what?" feel?  I didn't get that with this.  Everything was wrapped up perfectly.  It also helps that this show wasn't going into the future, but reflecting on the past.  I'm not sad that there will never be a second season.  In fact, I'm glad.  There are very few shows that can keep up quality beyond 26 episodes, and those that do still will never have an ending quite like this.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I'll be carrying that weight, but I'll certainly have this show to carry with me.

            There's not much left to say about Cowboy Bebop anymore. Smarter people than I have waxed wonderful things about the series. I'm a sucker for cool, and Cowboy Bebop oozes cool. It's cool without sacrificing humanity; there are moments within this series (particularly during the last quarter) that are as emotionally taut as anything you'll find in anime. The individual arcs mirror the jazz theme that kicks off each episode: Scattered, seemingly rushed and incomplete. It's when you abandon your need for A to B to C storytelling that Cowboy Bebop's beauty shines. (I wouldn't go so far as to say you need some jazz

             background to enjoy Bebop, but I would also so that I liked Bebop on a rewatch much more after I had a jazz obsession phase.)

            Cowboy Bebop... I feel like everything that can be said about this show has been said. It is widely regarded as one of the best anime to have ever been released, with fantastic and memorable characters, great animation, a fantastic soundtrack and one of the best English dubs ever. As this is one of my favourite shows this will be more of a gush than a review as there are very few flaws in this show, but i just really wanted to talk about Bebop. So lets get down to it.
            <br>
             <br>
              Story: 10/10. Cowboy Bebop follows the adventures of a ragtag group of bounty hunters (known
              <span id="review282708" style="display: none;">
               as Cowboys) who travel on a space ship called the Bebop. The effortlessly cool Spike Spiegel, the grizzled ex detective Jet Black, the seductive femme fatale Faye Valentine, the incredibly smart but strange Ed and Ein a super smart welsh corgi. Bebop follows an episodic format with pretty much each episode having little or no collection to episodes previous save for a few, now something like this doesn't always work for shows Bebop is one of the best examples of how to do it right, every episode has an interesting story to follow and most of them reveal little or massive details of our lead casts backstories, and even if they don't the stories told themselves are interesting enough to keep your attention. They can also allow for the show to play with the tone of each episode and still have it work to the shows advantage with some being played more for comedy, and others having more drama. Some of my favourite episodes include the episodes Cowboy Funk, in my opinion one of the funniest episodes in the series, Pierrot Le Fou which has one of the most chilling endings to an anime episode I've ever seen and Ballad of Fallen Angels the fifth episode which i suggest is the episode you need to watch up to before deciding to drop it or not as it tells a fantastic story, has one of the best shootout scenes ever and a beautiful scene involving a church window which is all i'm gonna say. To cap it all off the final episode of Bebop is incredible leading to an amazing final scene and an iconic ending. Simply put though Bebop doesn't have much of an overarching story the individual stories it tells are pretty much all fantastic, and when it's overarching story kicks in it only gets better.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Art: 10/10. At the time of writing this Cowboy Bebop is 20 years old (originally airing in April 1998) and even 20 years on from it's initial airing the show still looks amazing. Bebop is a sci fi and it takes a similar approach to its setting that the original Star Wars movies took. The world looks and feels lived in and the art and animation really help convey that. For example the Bebop is a run down second hand ship that looks like something these type of people would live in, it's very similar to Start Wars Millennium Falcon. The environments also have this aesthetic, they look run down and lived in, simply put the world Bebop presents feels real. But where Bebop shines here is in its animation which is basically perfect, everything moves naturally and very smooth. An example of this comes from Spike who's fighting style is inspired by Bruce Lee's Jeet Kun Do and this really shines through in the animation as shown in the first episode during his fight with Azimov, it's also important to remember that all of this was hand drawn as opposed to the digital animation used today which makes how smooth everything moves even more impressive.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Sound: 10/10. Right so lets just jump in here, Bebop's soundtrack is one of the best ever composed for an anime. Yoko Kanno is one of my favourite anime composers primarily due to her range as a composer, with shows like this, Stand Alone Complex and Zankyou no Terror really showing off the different types of sounds she can produce. But Bebop is easily her best work, with a super catchy smooth jazz soundtrack as well as the amazing Rain played during episode 5. Let's not forget Bebops iconic OP Tank that never fails to get you excited to watch the series, also you'll likely be humming it for weeks to come once you've heard it. Aside from the OST the actual sound effects are also great with the ships sounding fantastic, fight scenes sounding very impactful either in fist fights or shootouts and the general foley being great. Also as stated before Bebop has one of the best English dubs to have ever been produced with all the VAs fitting their characters perfectly and providing some A+ acting. Full disclosure I have never actually watched this show in Japanese so I can't comment on the subbed but I am sure it's equally as good.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Characters: 10/10. Bebop's strength lies in it's characters, the crew of the Bebop are diverse and interesting with pretty much everyone being fleshed out incredibly. My favourite thing abut the show is that the crew for the most part can't really stand each other, but due to their circumstances (that being they can never really get money due to screwing up bounties or Faye gambling it all away) they are forced to put up with each other in order to get by. While he characters all start out entertaining once you begin to delve into their pasts you begin to see how damaged they all are (Spike and Faye in particular have amazing backstories) taking them from entertaining tropes to fleshed out and memorable characters who you'll remember for years to come. Aside from our crew the series has many side characters who mostly make one off appearances, though a few appear in multiple episodes. These characters work for the episodes they are involved in but some of them are just as memorable as our lead cast. For those curious the series does have an antagonist, Vicious who has ties to Spike which i won't say here. But he is a fantastic foe portrayed as cold and merciless with his story throughout the series being very well done. If i had one complaint with the show here it primarily comes from the character of Ed, who while very entertaining and likeable but i feel isn't as fleshed out as the others on the Bebop, she does get some backstory towards the end of the show but i would've liked a bit more. But that's just a minor complaint in the end and doesn't effect my overall thoughts n the show.

               Enjoyment: 10/10. Bebop is an engaging watch, it hooks you with its amazing characters and setting and takes you along for the ride and by the end of its 26 episodes you'll have been left fully satisfied. Bebop is one of those few shows that if it had like 500 episodes i could watch every single one of them as the characters are just so damn likeable. But I feel it ended when it should've and it just makes the show even better.

               Overall: 10/10. In the end I probably didn't need to write this review, but I just wanted to gush about one of my favourite shows ever made. Put simply if you've never seen Bebop. Watch it, if your a fan of sci fi, great action, characters and just anime in general. Bebop is something you owe it to yourself to watch it's just that good.

            Cowboy Bebop is not a show for everyone. It's not a plot heavy show, with only about 4 or 5 episodes furthering the story, the rest being episodic. It lacks the high adrenaline levels received when watching a shonen. If this all sounds like stuff you don't like, it might be better for you to spend your time on another show you know you will enjoy. However, if you don't mind all these things you may just find a show that will stay in your head forever.

             Cowboy Bebop is a show about the crew of a spaceship called the Bebop. Each episode they search
             <span id="review294246" style="display: none;">
              for bounties in order to receive enough money to scrape by. Although most of these episodes follow their adventures in searching for those bounties, each episode is distinctly unique. This largely due to the Bebop crew. Each character has their individual personality, creating a group with consistently entertaining interactions. The characters never feel boring or dull, yet no character's personality is overshadowed by another.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It's these characters that elevate the story. Each member of the crew has a past in which they may have attempted to escape from, but is beginning to catch up to them. The beauty of the show comes from the way these plot threads are organically woven into the story. These characters' pasts are a big part of their lives, but they don't dwell on it for too long. Most of the time they're too busy trying to earn money to even think about it. However sometimes unfinished business appears that they cannot delay, allowing different sides of their personalities to show. It's in these moments that the characters, alongside the show, adopt a more serious tone that gives them both an added depth.

              <br/>
              There are many other things that make Cowboy Bebop great. The voice acting in the Japanese dub is top-notch, certain moments of the show feature stunning animation, and the soundtrack is amazing. However it's not just one of these elements that make this show the mature and artistic show that it is, it's all of them working together. If you feel like this show is up your ally, you should watch it. It is a show that will stay with you.

             WARNING: MY OPINION, AN OPINION FROM NOV 2020.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I KNOW THAT THIS IS SOME EPISODIC ANIME bu I'm just gonna be straight about this. This anime is somewhat boring and cliche. Maybe because I've watched way too much anime that I've been through a lot of anime plot lines. The story is simple really, everything just became really good when Julia came in and my fav episode? the LAST episode. It just gave me chills and that's when I felt like "it was good". I am so sorry to disappoint CB fans or people who will criticize this review but this is just
             <span id="review364008" style="display: none;">
              what I feel. ART * SOUND were decent. Characters were good but I don't see any chemistry around them as a group or teammates? Now did I enjoy it? it's pretty decent. It's not SUPER boring but it's boring. My definition of my boring is that why am I still watching this? This was a classic, gave it a 6 thanks to the first and last episode. I wish there was more. Sorry to disappoint everyone but if you would wanna try it, please try it. This anime was fair enough.

            I want to preface this review by saying that the "classic" armor that this show has been given is a pile of shit. If you don't like it, don't be discouraged to let it be known. The show certainly has its issues.
            <br>
             <br/>
             But fuck all that for now, let me tell you why I'm giving it a solid 10.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The art, considering the show was made in the 90's, is absolutely superb. Everything about this show's art is as it should be.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The story, which I will not spoil, is absolutely masterminded (apart from a couple of things here and there). It goes in and out with a
             <span id="review362116" style="display: none;">
              bang.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The music, oh my god, the music. Every time I listen to that opening theme my dick is at half mast.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The characters are simple and complex at the same time, and they compliment each other quite well, in most cases. This is where my few issues with the show come into play.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall my enjoyment of the show is about as high as it's ever been for any other. In my humble and often bullshit opinion, it's a masterpiece. Even people who hate anime, and, let's be honest, there are plenty of reasons why, would be people I could recommend this to. It's just that good.
              <br/>

            I've heard a lot of people call Cowboy Bebop the gateway drug for anime. After watching it I agree 100%. It was the first anime I watched and it introduced me to this wonderful world and I can't thank it enough. Everything about Bebop is perfect. I can't say that for any other anime even if I love it. Nothing about it should change it's perfect as it is and anyone who likes movies or cartoons, doesn't have to be anime, would absolutely love this show.
            <br>
             <br/>
             The story is perfectly wrapped in some episodic instances. The ratio between them is ideal.
             <br/>
             It has a beggining and
             <span id="review310572" style="display: none;">
              an ending and everything in between.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The art is old-school but it's honestly some of the best art I've seen.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sounds and music are insanely good. I listen to Cowboy Bebop soundtracks in my daily life.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters develop perfectly with the story it all works.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoymnet I think you can guess was insane.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I feel like writing this review is dumb because it's just praising something wildly and having no bad opinions that people often want but I genuinely have nothing to complain about this anime and I'm yet to find one that comes so far like Cowboy Bebop has &lt;3

            Cowboy Bebop. Wow. What can I say that hasn't already been said? Instead of just writing a straightforward review, let me tell you WHY this is probably in my top 3 anime series of all time.
            <br>
             <br/>
             -It's got interesting characters
             <br/>
             -The fight scenes are choreographed so well and the jazz-like music in the background mixes so well with the mood
             <br/>
             -It has a fairly non-linear plot, so many of the episodes could be watched on their own without missing any important information from the previous episode
             <br/>
             -It's got an amazing ending, perhaps one of the best of all time
             <br/>
             -It doesn't ever take itself too seriously, but at the same
             <span id="review96135" style="display: none;">
              time never attempts to be campy.
              <br/>
              -The music tends to be awesome
              <br/>
              -A large variety of different episodes; from the serious nature of the last two episodes to the goofy nature of the mushroom episode
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I could go on. Let me just end with this: this was one of the first serious anime series that I ever watched (was about 13 or so when I first saw CB) and is still  is one of my all-time favorite series.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Bottom line: check out Cowboy Bebop if you haven't. There's a good chance that you'll find at least one thing from this show that you'll really like.

            Cowboy bebop is a very rare anime in the sense that there really isn't too much to the story, yet it is still a very entertaining and enjoyable series. It's is just about the only anime where the english dub is probably better than the japanese language version. On a personal note though, I enjoyed the Cowboy Bebop movie a little more than the show.
            <br>
             Definitely worth watching multiple times.

            This anime called "Cowboy Bebop" is a very funny and quite well illustrated show that includes hilarious characters and also very bureaucratic characters, but as in bounty hunters.
            <br>
             <br/>
             The anime has a somewhat a good plot leading off with random skits of funniness and back to the main story, the art style is an old crisp style and I would have to say it matches the type of show that it is.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The sound was fine with the vehicles / shootings / etc., Some of the characters sound very weird at first but then you'll get used to their voice.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The characters all have very
             <span id="review178123" style="display: none;">
              different types of personalities, they have a funny / serious type to all the characters in the story.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I very much enjoyed the whole thing, and I would have to give the whole thing a 9.
              <br/>
              I really hope you enjoy reading this review and have a good day!

            Cowboy bebop is an anime that was written by Keiko Nobumoto in 1998. The story takes place in the year 2071 follows what starts off as a pair of bounty hunters named Spike and Jet who travel aboard the spacecraft 'bebop'.  As the series progresses, their group quickly grows to five with the addition of the data dog Ein, an odd woman named Faye Valentine and a little girl named Edward, who seems to be the brains of the operation while still being totally childish.Technically speaking, out of Bebop's twenty six episodes, only five of them have any plot element to them, the rest
            <span id="review36490" style="display: none;">
             are totally episodic. These one episode stand-alones can range from incredibly silly (Mushroom samba) to incredibly deep and sad (Perriot de fou). However, no matter what, every episode strives to add something to one, or even all of our main characters. Bebop certainly shines most when it's exploring the actual plot, but these episodes wouldn't shine as much if they hadn't spent so much time giving depth to the characters. The actual plot of the show is about Spike's feud with a man named Vicious. I won't dive much further into details, as to not to spoil, though. It finally concludes with what is rightfully known as one of the most fitting ends to an anime series.
             <br>
              <br/>
              Now we'll touch on the characters. It's impossible not to love someone in the main cast. They are all very well developed and loveable characters. From the cool and thoughtful Jet to the odd and off the wall Edward, there's always someone to love. Spike himself is also a great character, however, I'm sure most people have heard enough about how cool he is, and although it's true, I shan't go on about it any more than that. Faye is a real femme fatale and a very strong female character that is very independent, but can also come off as rather cold and selfish, and she is. She is also often as foolish as Spike, can also match him in terms of bravery. Ed's weird, that much is certain, but it doesn't make her annoying, her brand of weird just makes her more likeable, which is something not so easily pulled off. As mentioned, Spike is cool, foolish, brave and stubborn. He is also intelligent when he needs to be, but likes to wallow in the past even when he tells others not to. Jet is a strong leader of the group, who often keeps the group together and keeps them from hurting themselves. Without him, who knows how much more trouble the crew would get in. Overall, bebop has an outstanding cast of characters, among whom you will find at least one character to love.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The animation is another great point for bebop. This show was made over ten years ago, but the animation matches up to the best of the best today. It's clear how much effort went into every frame. The characters have large (although not as large as some anime) eyes that display strong emotions, but for the most part, the characters look and move much like real humans. The animals are also probably some of the more realistic animals seen in animation. They look and move more like actual animals rather than cartoons.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              What do we all know about bebop? The music of course! Bebop's soundtrack fits so masterfully with the show that it is impossible to ignore and impossible to forget. The oddest songs play at the most seemingly out of place of times and really have no business working as well as they always do. The music in Cowboy bebop is always spot-on and never misses, ever. Yoko Kanno always does a great job, another example of her work being the score in Wolf's rain, which was also created by Keiko Nobumoto. Oddly enough, though, the soundtrack listened to without the show just isn't quite the same. The music needs the show to be effective, but when paired with the show, it is just that, very effective. It is also a mix of so many different genres, most prominent being Jazz, but there are also many other genres mixed in here and there. The opening (Tank) and ending (The Real folk blues) credits are also a force to be reckoned with, both fitting the series extremely well and you never want to skip them. Both of them are extremely well done and probably some of the best in anime.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The voice acting, although strong in Japanese, is a treat to watch in English. The English voice actors really breathe new life into their characters. The main example of this being Melissa Charles as Edward. She is the one who makes Edward so loveable. She made her odd personality charming rather than annoying, which the Japanese voice actor didn't quite do. Of course, everyone in the English cast is top-notch and you should definitely watch this one in English, Edward just needed special mention.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall, while Bebop's premise may not be entirely original, the execution is outstanding, it's an exciting show with a lot to offer. It can and will be enjoyed by just about anyone. It's one and only shortcoming is the fact that the story is episodic for the most part, which may turn some people off, but this is overcome with a strong cast, amazing visuals and a breathtaking musical score, along with the fact that when the plot of the story shows up, it is even more exciting than the stand alones that were great to begin with. This show simply cannot be compared to anything in existence.

            Well, that was all over the place. I think I finally ''got'' this series just about the time I finished it... maybe, I mean, I now kinda get how it's great and unique in a way. That there's a reason it's held in high regards. But I can't ignore that I was pretty much bored by at least a third of it. What I disliked about it: old production means it's slow. Seriously, 120-130% seems like natural playback speed in most cases. It's very episodic, and one of things I most like about serious anime is that they're often not episodic.
            <br>
             <br/>
             However, it's hard to
             <span id="review193050" style="display: none;">
              call Bebop serious. At times it's downright trolling the viewer, similar as Champloo (also by Watanabe). Troll moments and episodes were probably my favorite parts as I felt they were comical and really effective given the setting. Then there are many ''serious'' episodes that just cover some minor side story, and I found most of them boring. Most of them would provide some minor character or plot development and rely on rule of cool a lot, as nearly all action is spectacle, often with troll physics included. Not in TTGL sense, but not too far either. It takes some getting used to since setting and style appear quite serious/real.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Then there are episodes that really develop and explore a particular character, and even episodes that explore serious topics and cover them surprisingly well. I felt that characters took forever to develop, which resulted in me only feeling attached to them by the time of ending episodes. Naturally, it made me enjoy the last third of the anime more, and pretty great ending only adds to it. Animation is great for its time, but it's really aged and I can't say I didn't mind. I think I would have enjoyed it much more if it was less episodic, picked up the pace, cut out a third of the episodes, and switch focus from being all over the place to comedy, at least in earlier episodes. It's similar to Champloo in many ways, but I definitely liked Champloo better.

            This short review reflects my honest opinion about this show, I don't intend to spark a flame war with it and I'm writing simply my sincere thoughts about this series.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop is an anime that has been long since praised and is regarded as a cornerstone of Japanese animation, unfortunately, the show didn't struck me as impressive in spite of having watched it more than twice over the years.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Story: 3
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The story is set in the year 2071 and revolves around bounty hunters, specifically Spike Spiegel and his "partner", Jet Black, who make a living by chasing criminals of the solar system, later on, the
             <span id="review238108" style="display: none;">
              crew grows larger thanks to the voluptuous Faye Valentine and the skilled hacker Edward.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The plot doesn't show any sign of plot progress until the fifth episode, where Spike's former friend and nemesis, Vicious is introduced, however, the plot of the various episodes fluctuates between linear bounty hunting and secondary or rather silly episodes that barely bear any significant change to the story, this is exactly what disappointed me the most, in fact, the show could be summed up in three or more episodes, perhaps I'm being hyperbolic here, but twelve episodes could have worked just as well. Frankly, episodes like "Mushroom Samba" bore me to death no matter how many times I rewatched the show, the fact is that Cowboy Bebop is full of these kind of episodes, hence forcing myself to watch it took me several efforts, as it goes without saying that it wasn't easy.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art: 7
              <br/>
              The animation doesn't belong in the trash, but neither is anything stunning from my point of view, although it makes the show enjoyable, there's not much to say about it.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound: 8
              <br/>
              Music is one of the strongest points of the series, I always appreciate Yoko Kanno's works and the songs she composed for this show are no exception, almost every song in the show is worthy of being called memorable, as you'll probably wish to listen to the soundtrack at least once in your life.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Character: 5
              <br/>
              It's unfortunate the characters don't match my taste at all, I guess I just can't relate to any of them or found them utterly generic, I like Spike, he's a cool and skilled guy and everything, but it doesn't get deeper than that, even after his backstory was explained along with Jet Black's and Faye's, it didn't impress me in the slightest, the characters are still cliched to the core from the beginning to the end of the anime, thus I can't help but say that I disliked them.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoyment: 6
              <br/>
              I always believed that if might have watched the show back when it came out, I would've enjoyed it much more. In my opinion, Cowboy Bebop has aged and nowadays it can't be regarded as a masterpiece as back then.
              <br/>
              I prefer shows like Darker than Black or Dimension W over it, while the two aren't as praised as much as Bebop, they don't feel nearly as generic as it. I enjoyed the ending which took a very unique turn for the better, but all I can say about Cowboy Bebop is that it's an okay show, and doesn't deserve the praise it gets.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall: 5
              <br/>
              From my previous experiences, I have a hunch that I'm going to anger the fandom. be labelled as a troll or a person with considerably "shit taste" one way or the other, but it doesn't influence my thoughts about the show. I didn't enjoy Cowboy Bebop, but I could have enjoyed it if I watched it in the age it came out. This brief review only describes my subjective opinion and is in no way meant to offend somebody.

            Cowboy Bebop is a show that no matter how many times I watch it, it never gets old. The characters are all unique and add their own "pizzazz" to the fantastic story. That, along with the beautiful artwork and soundtrack that's catchy as all get out make this one of my top five animes.
