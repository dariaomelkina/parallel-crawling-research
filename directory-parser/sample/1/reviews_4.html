             Cowboy Bebop was one of the first few anime that I properly sat down and watched. After the horrible atrocity that was Fate/Zero I asked my friend to give me something "a little different", perhaps a little more "western" in its storytelling. Mainly because I had some pretty ignorant assumptions on cultural storytelling back then.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Well, he was nice enough to give me Cowboy Bebop. A show he described as, "the most western anime ever." Cool. I sat down and watched it in about a week.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I left with a few mixed feelings, but overall, it was a positive experience that I think many anime
             <span id="review229418" style="display: none;">
              fans rightfully call a "classic" in the medium. Much like the show, i'll break up this review into small digestible chunks.

              <br/>
              PART 1 : The Purpose of a Genre
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Television works in funny ways. Well, not really funny as much as generic, obvious, and pandering. Even in Japan, where the entire culture is different than America's, the way television (and film) is created is still similar. The demographic of the script is determined, the show/film gets its director and production company, it gets funded, and the shooting begins. That's one of the many ways something can get started.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The key term here is demographic. Everything is made for an audience, and that audience is everything for what's being made. Put simply, if no one is watching and buying; then your product is caput. The way you make sure that at least someone will watch and buy is by determining something called a demographic. Which pretty much means the sex and age range of an audience.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              For example, a show like Sword Art Online is made with the 13-17 male demographic, however, it has reaches into the 18-27 male demographic as well. The show is adapted from the manga(or is it a LN i'm not sure) with the same key demographic. So a bunch of people come together and talk about what people in that age like.
              <br/>
              <br/>

              <br/>
              <br/>
              Flashy animation when fighting actually happens : Check
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ...
              <br/>
              <br/>
              With these concepts they created the most generic and marketable show possible. Their show is the literal equivalent of oatmeal with nothing on it. Something that's easily edible.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              But the point is that these people created this show with this audience in mind. This means that the show excels (hopefully) at these certain things. If you need fan service to appeal to a bunch of horny teenage boys, then you try your best to make it be some really damn good fan service! If you need loud moralistic anime protagonist, you better get the most generic possible self-insert wish-fulfilling protagonist you can!
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So while this show may suck massive meat-wagons its still a show that excels at those things.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ...
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This leads me to Cowboy Bebop. A show that doesn't really excel at anything. A show that doesn't really fit in a base genre. Sure people sometimes call it a "space opera" but that's a horribly defined genre, in my opinion. It pretty much encapsulates every possible base genre. It has comedy, horror, drama, action, and mystery.
              <br/>
              <br/>

              PART 2 : Lack of a Flavor is More of a Flavor
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So what exactly does "it just kinda does everything pretty good", mean? Well for one it means that I came out of the show thoroughly...fine. Nothing really stood out as mind-blowing or even great, but everything flowed decently well that I never really found the show to be a slog to sit through. The entire thing felt so harmless.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Its attempts at emotion were fine, its action was generally pretty good, the detours into more experimental one-off episodes was fairly pleasing as well. It had a decently designed cast with a cute little dog cause signature pets are cool to have. It had a story that flowed well, although wasn't given enough time to actually become something special. It followed an episodic structure that felt good to watch but ultimately didn't add much to the show... more on that later.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              With this lack of focused genre, it really felt like the show was just middle-of-the-pack on everything. Which is why I can't really bring myself to criticize all too much. It quite literally does almost everything well enough that I don't have much to say on it.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Our titular protagonist is a charming semi-douche that is ultimately more like-able and interesting than most anime protagonists. His companions are all fairly engaging too. Faye has a great character design, Jet has a nice presence, Edward is ultimately the comedic relief and so on.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Point is, the show is just good. Throughout all the episodes, which play out very episodically, I found myself not having any disdain towards any of them. Sure most of them weren't all too memorable... the standouts being one with mushrooms, one with a fridge, and one with a fat man floating around like a balloon. But overall, they had some decent sci-fi storylines with decent execution.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              __________________________________________________________________________________________________
              <br/>
              <br/>
              PART 3 : Story Without Story
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So the one thing that bugged me about the show was its execution of the main storyline. While its episodic by nature, every half-way point we have a story-driven episode that revolves around our protagonist, Spike. I won't spoil what its about but it involves love and heartbreak, duh.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So with these story-driven episodes, the show shifts from meandering fourth gear to a full-out lore-mode fifth gear. The switch doesn't often feel natural, but the episodes themselves are all generally pretty good.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              However, the biggest issue is that the writers don't give these stories enough time. I can think of a handful of disconnected episodes that could've been cut in favor of creating a more interesting and believable story.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Since this whole story-arc literally takes only five episodes to resolve, the other twenty one episodes are just kind of there. Five episodes is hardly enough time to create any believable characters or engaging interactions that lead to a very bombastic conclusion in a way that feels emotionally powerful.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Specifically, Spike's love from his past, Julia, gets a truly pitiful amount of development. This creates scenes that are meant to be emotional into yet another "ok" scene. It doesn't feel bad as much as it just feels "ok".
              <br/>
              <br/>
              But the reason I feel like i can't give a show a pass for this is because they played this entire thing out like it was supposed to be something bigger. A big arc. But they didn't give it enough time. Why do an episodic series of twenty six episodes and only give the story five? Especially if you only want one season? It felt like a nonsensical idea to me.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              __________________________________________________________________________________________________
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Conclusion :
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Honestly, this review seems harsher than it needs to be. Saying the show is "mediocre" would mean its a 5.0/10. Its not mediocre. Its definitely above average, and the character interaction, for the most part, is good enough to elevate the show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It has some very well choreographed fight sequences and some very genuine moments. Its overall a very pleasant show to watch. For me, it isn't the untouchable classic that many may call it, its still a good time that i'd recommend to any fan of television.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It may have not thought out its base storyline enough to make it something special, but some of the standout episodic episodes do more than enough to create a smooth and memorable experience.
              <br/>

            The almighty and legendary Cowboy Bebop. Well, here goes my best shot.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Story: 7,5
             <br/>
             At first to me it seemed like Cowboy Bebop will be an episodic anime, which ones are usually plain bad and become boring after a few episodes. But Cowboy Bebop is a proof that anime mustn't evolve a single plot straight only to conclusion. Truth be said most of the Cowboy Bebop episodes are fillers, but not to the bad meaning of the fillers that you usually see in Naruto or Bleach or any other anime.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             In Cowboy Bebop these episodes are more like expansions off the characters and mini stories with
             <span id="review48839" style="display: none;">
              their own thoughts and meaning. Almost all of the episodes have some points to make and are relevant to the characters. They allow you to get more attached to characters. Sometimes you get small flashbacks in some episodes and they improve your understanding of how human and realistic these characters are.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As for the plot relevant episodes I would really have wanted more of them, because they seemed to answer a lot of questions, but not enough to satisfy my curiosity. I really would want to know more about Spikes past. And the ending even though very cool and memorable for me seemed a bit dissapointing. Also if you think about it the main story is kinda cliche if not for the ending.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Visuals: 9,25

              The visuals are more then you should ask for. Cowboy Bebop was made in 1998 and truth be it has put to shame other anime since 1998 to even now as for the visuals. The best I liked about it was how detailed it was, all the characters are easy to distinguish and backgrounds are very beautiful too. Backgrounds change a lot of times as the Bebop crew goes from different planets starting to mostly deserted planets to snowy cold planets.

              As for the animation it is very smooth and fluid, the action is very well choreographed and only once I saw repeated movement and I think it was done on purpose to make Ed look silly, not because the animators were lazy.

              Sound: 10
              <br/>
              Everything about sound is just WOW and awesome to the extreme. The opening is great and I didn't skip it once for all 26 episodes.

              As for the background music there is a lot of it and even though it mostly consists of jazz, bebop and bluze it also had one episode with heavy metal and some other music too. The background music usually surprised me of how good it was all out through the series. That background music just made every major moment in this anime just so much more memorable and enjoyable.That's what you get from Yoko Kanno.

              I personally only have seen the dub, but from what I heard it is one of the best, if not the best dubs out there . I think that Steve Blumes role as Spike Spiegel is his best.

              Characters: 8
              <br/>
              It's not like you really get a lot of time spent on building up the characters, but somehow on the way you pick up pieces about Spike, Faye, Jet and Ed. As the series progresses you get some parts of there back-stories, but you don't get all of it. Well at least I thought that there could of been more back-stories for them. But I have to admit that it helped for extra realism that you don't know all about these characters from the start even to the end there are a lot mystery around them.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As for other characters they show up and disappear very soon except Vicous the villain ( his name sounds like a villain already)  who I didn't like, because a real villain needs to have a fucking good reason to be a villain, but all I got from him is that he has bad past with Spike, which really doesn't explain a lot, because we don't know much about Spikes past except for few flashbacks.

              I enjoyed this anime a lot. Never did I get bored watching it and most of the time I was stuck to screen sitting on the edge of my seat. But I have to say that once the episode was done I wasn't that reluctant to go watch the next episode, because there wasn't an overarching plot that would connect from one episode to the next.

              The best part about Cowboy Bebop was the music and animation. The production value for this anime was very high even for nowadays standards. I have to say that I didn't like the story that much because I found it cliche a bit and the characters even though cool and pretty much realistic they didn't really relate to me. But also I must admit that this anime has something that you really can't categorize and that is style. And that style just makes all those bad things I said about it almost meaningless.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I would recommend this anime to every anime fan and even to people that haven't seen any anime, because it has a lot of good qualities that could interest non-anime people into watching it. As for those people who care more about the stories morals and what it has to tell you about everything I would not advise you to jump in watching this anime with high expectations, because Cowboy Bebop is more about style over matter.

            Spike Spiegel is a bounty hunter with a dark, violent past. Nowadays, he roams between the seedier colonies of space along with his partner Jet Black and their spaceship Bebop as they try to catch a bounty or two, barely making a living at it. Some of their bounties, like the mysterious Faye Valentine and the intelligent 'data dog', Ein, end up as fellow partners. Is Spike trying to justify prior misdeeds by working for the right side of the law? What will happen when his past catches up to him? And what of the pasts of his fellow shipmates? Will any of them survive
            <span id="review196889" style="display: none;">
             long enough to find out?
             <br>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop has been often referred to as the new anime noir, a title that does fit, but doesn't even begin to fully describe it. Equal parts film noir, spaghetti western, and 70's cop show; Cowboy Bebop is both retro and fresh at the same time. A very stylish, beautifully crafted series that deserves much more attention than it gets. If ever there was a series more deserving to be a sleeper hit, Bebop is it.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is well suited to TV. Each episode manages to stand alone, but at the same time link together an overall larger story. Even if you only see two or three episodes, not exactly in order, one wouldn't be lost, and would find enjoyment in them. In order to truly appreciate it, though, one must see it through.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop also presents a realistic view of the future. Spike and Jet travel in what to us would be a highly sophisticated craft, but to them is the modern day equivalent of a 1976 El Camino. The places they visit are far from what one would expect. Instead of Neo-Tokyo with its shiny, impossibly tall skyscrapers that never end, we have Neo-Tijuana, with its dusty dirt roads, run down shacks and migrant workers. Space is ethnic, but not in the Star Trek sanitized for the sake of politically correctness way. Each colony reflects a melting pot more akin to Los Angeles or New York City than any Blade Runner wannabe ever could.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This striving for realism also is reflected in the character designs. Spike is lanky and handsome in his own way, but by no means is he a slender pretty boy. Faye is sexy and curvy, but she's no large breasted bimbo. Jet is burly, not fat, and has traits that would make one think he is of Russian descent. Ein can easily be recognized as a Welsh corgi, and not just another undistinguishable mutt. The only one who looks remotely like a 'cartoony' character is Ed, and even then no one would ever mistake her as anything -but- a scrawny preteen tomboy. (And to see her name and appearance, you'd think she just got off the boat from the Philippines.)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The animation is beyond superb. Its quality excels over most current releases. Cowboy Bebop uses computer graphics, but does so in such a fluid, breathtaking manner. There are practically no scenes that feel 'artificial', like what's going on in the foreground is totally separate from the background. Many computer-generated anime can't seem to shake the look that the characters are just floating in front of the background stills. Everything in Cowboy Bebop seems to breathe with life and motion, even in otherwise stoic scenes, and it's a rarity and a marvel to behold.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Another bonus Cowboy Bebop has going for it is the soundtrack. Yoko Kanno scores (literally) again with her work for this series. The opening theme alone is already one of *the* best intro pieces I have ever heard. The blend of jazz and blues is absolutely perfect in setting the mood of the series. I ask you, has this woman ever -done- any bad music? (Of course not!)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Then there's the storyline. Even though each episode stands quite well on its own, with poignant moments interspersed with exciting action, the underlying theme of Spike Spiegel and his motivations for what he does is absolutely intriguing. With each flashback, you get one more piece of the puzzle, from Spike's shady origins to the loves that influenced the way he is. Maybe his bounty hunting is really a search for identity as much as a way of life he has chosen. The plot and characterization in Cowboy Bebop have a sophistication and subtlety that is practically one-of-a-kind. It's hard to find movies this involving, much less animated television series. Cowboy Bebop simply puts most anime...and Hollywood, to shame.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              On the surface, it's easy to dismiss as '70s retro fluff. "Hey, there's Vega$ all over again!" And yes, many a Japanese and American movie star or feature is lampooned in one form or another during each episode. Cases in point: Spike Spiegel is a postmodern Lupin III. And in the first episode alone, Asimov Sorenson and Katarina.... can we say Desperado, kids? (Heck, even Quentin Tarantino seems to have a cameo!) But beneath that noir veneer is a very human drama that has just enough humor and clever dialogue to be realistic, yet highly entertaining. This is a must-have for any serious collector of Japanese animation.
              <br/>
              Simply put, this anime is one of the best.

            I really didn't think that this anime would turn out to be one of my favorites, there's nothing negative about this anime, it's just perfect. If you're thinking about whether to watch this or not, I would say go for it, this won't disappoint you. (only 26 episodes).

             This 90s classic anime starts with the episodic format where the main characters Spike Speigel and Jet Black catch their bounties and live with that money (Woolongs). Each episode comes up with a masterful plot in the same while introducing the other two main characters and our antagonist. We will get to know our Bebop gang's backstory as
             <span id="review368699" style="display: none;">
              the story goes on, we'll be introduced to a wide range of characters with whom our gang members had a past.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The anime is futuristic and adds all the elements to it as they should instead of dragging it. All the characters are likable, the music is too good and the ending is the best.

            This was the first anime I ever watched that made me completely re-evaluate what was possible in an animated medium. Not only that but despite the improvements in computers and technology that have allowed anime to become more visually astouding, cowboy bebop managed to achieve the same levels of detail and motion of modern anime over a decade ago.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Do not approach cowboy bebop as being anime. It is animated, but really it is more like live action then a cartoon. The creators of this show did not skimp when it came to fully animating fight scenes, space battles, or even some of the more idle
             <span id="review23682" style="display: none;">
              moments. There is never a moment where footage is recycled or cheesy backgrounds go flying by while characters strike a pose, nor are there any chibi or emoted moments.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is also best if not rushed through, there IS an overall story arc, but most of the episodes are self contained, and do not really require rapid succession. Also when you complete this anime you will surely feel that the show is concluded, and that a sequel or serialization of the series is unnecessary. This show is good enough to re-watch and still find the same enjoyment as the first time you saw it.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Usually its difficult to fully decide how to rank anime since there are many ways to do it, such as by overall plot (i HATE cop-out endings which are typical of most shows.. curse you school rumble!), quality of art/animation/ visual excellence, music, voice talent, dub (if applicable), characters/character development, and something that is sometimes neglected is depth (how much do you have to allready know to fully enjoy an anime). However, Cowboy Bebop excels in every one of these areas, so it makes it easy for me to give this show 10's across the board, it truly is a masterpiece, and is not as difficult as EVA to fully appreciate, as it does not require you to wikipedia info on Jewish Mythology, Kabalism, Sephiroths, ect. and can be watched in English without sacrificing any aspect of the show, which also makes this show a great candidate for newbies to serious (non serialized) anime.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ON A SPECIAL NOTE:
              <br/>
              Yoko Kanno is quite possibly one of the greatest film composers, and wrote a ludicrous amount of FULL LENGTH music for this show. If the quality of the anime isn't enough to get your rocks off there are about 8 cd's worth of top notch music, (mostly jazz, blues, and gospel) all origional work composed for this series which I also recommend to you audiophiles. The Seatbelts are awesome...

            Frankly, I'm not sure how I can do a show like Cowboy Bebop justice in reviewing it in such tiny space. I think Cowboy Bebop is absolutely a product of genius. I think genius minds conceived and executed the concepts, story, and production of this series, and I believe it will always mean a great deal to me. I say this with the utmost concern for nostalgia and trying to disappate it, judging the show by its merits and not for the time at which I watched it and how radical it was at the time, but rather for what it continues to be based
            <span id="review32325" style="display: none;">
             on its true merits.
             <br>
              <br/>
              For one, I can see why others may dislike elements of the show, but those are the same elements I think are justified. The show is episodic, yes, but rather than being a bunch of completely unrelated adventures that just feature the core cast in different situations, the episodes are more like a series of short little films that each reveal a little more of the bigger picture, not necessarily of the main underlying plot, but something much more important, which is the world and atmosphere, the environment and attitudes which are pervasive in the show. The very lives of the characters are "episodic", but an episode rarely ends without having made some headway in unveiling more of the tapestry of this world the characters live in.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The main plot, the plot of Spike's past with the Red Dragon, that's something that keeps together the threads, but ultimately only exemplifies- well, perhaps more than that, epitomizes- the grander attitude of the entire work. Given more time to breath, perhaps a more traditionally strong narrative would  have worked its way out, which is probably the only flaw I can find with this show. However, it's barely a flaw, because it serves as a great and tragic sword of Damocles over the throne of the viewer. However, unlike that sword, it does certainly strike, and surely, and with consequence.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The production values are quite breathtaking, some still by today's standards. The music is especially spellbinding. The show is very stylish, and so more cynical folks may be lured into believing the show is "style over substance", but the style becomes part of its substance, much in the way a Tarintino film both indulges in and skewers pop art culture.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It's a show that feels almost as new every new time I watch as it did the first time. Sure, now I've been exposed to several anime that closely rival its greatness. But none of them quite manage to match or surpass it.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is a stellar series. Perhaps the most representative of what anime can accomplish, It is both entertaining and provocative. It's a rousing jazzy ballad of the bizarre and the sorrowful. It's a must see for anyone.

            Right, so here's the thing. I have been told to watch this anime as one of the classics, and I will give it the fact that it is alright, but I also think it is massively overrated.
            <br>
             One of my biggest problems with the show is that you can watch the first 3 then last 2 episodes and it is still consistent as if the 20ish episodes in between did not even happen.
             <br/>
             The characters, music, and animation are all wonderful and I will praise it for that, but the show itself leaves little to no impact on me. I will probably be getting a lot
             <span id="review309115" style="display: none;">
              of "not helpful" reviews here because I will not be writing about any spoilers.
              <br/>
              Some of the comedy in the show is enjoyable and somewhat make up for the fact that it takes so long to do what it does.
              <br/>
              The reason why this anime scores so low for me is because it feels unnecessarily long and the pay off for the last two episodes was just straight up not worth it in my mind after sitting through some of the painstakingly boring episodes.
              <br/>
              It's an alright anime, it does not sit even close to the top of my recommendations, but it is a top recommendation for many others. Watch it if you want to, but this anime is just not the best and is the first anime I am writing a full review for because I know I stand in the minority when I say that this anime is really just okay.

            It is very easy to see why Cowboy Bebop took off so well in the United States and western world. The show is formatted in the same way that American animation is, for example Family Guy and Spongebob Squarepants. There is no true consistent plot conflict throughout the 26 episodes, practically every episode is a new thing happening. Going in this was unexpected for me, never having experienced an episodic anime. I dropped it after 3 episodes because it just felt bland and pointless.

             <span id="review350915" style="display: none;">
              every episode made it a unique viewing that I had not previously experienced with Japanese anime. Edward and Spike are just awesome at all times, but sadly Faye tends to fall on the more annoying side. The vague "Syndicate plot" that spanned across the show was pretty disappointing, and the ending just hurt without feeling full-filling. I didnt really feel like any characters arc concluded in the best way it could have. Edward should not have ran off with her dead beat dad, Faye took farrrr too long to change personalities, and Spike's death felt extremely unnecessary.

              Considering how similiar it is to Western animation, I think the show is best compared to Star Wars: Clone Wars. It is an extremely fun, exciting, sometimes comedic show that shouldn't be taken too seriously. For what it is, it is amazing. But it is a pretty basic show that is tough to be considered a masterpiece with how much plot convenience and the weak main plot it has.

            I normally don't write reviews until I've fully finished watching a show, and if my opinion changes at all, I'll update the review, but I have a lot to talk about as I find this specific anime - or rather the culture behind it - particularly fascinating.
            <br>
             <br/>
             This anime is touted as a classic, and is said by many to be the greatest anime of all time. And whilst I can see why people would think that, I personally feel so indifferent towards the show.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I have issue finding things I legitimately dislike about it beyond "it's a product of its time and hasn't aged well and
             <span id="review287769" style="display: none;">
              there's shows since that, in my opinion, have done similar things to what Cowboy Bebop does, but done them better", because I love the art, I love the soundtrack, and I love the characters.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              My only issue with Cowboy Bebop which is entirely irrelevant of its age, derives from it being an aesthetically driven show that relies on the subtleties and connotations of its aesthetics and scenery rather than actual quality storytelling per episode. So it has the whole "space western" aesthetic down to a T, and the characters are also great, but I'm not a fan of its style of storytelling. I'm not exactly expecting an epic from a show that's mostly episodic with only a few references to previous episodes, but I often find it confusing and sometimes straight up pretentious with how visual its storytelling tries to be. It doesn't really leave me on the edge of my seat wanting to know what happens next, though whilst this is partially due to me not liking the stylistic writing choices, I don't really feel that's what this show was going for either. For me personally, if you can't write your show in a way that grips me and makes me really want to find out what happens at the end of the episode, or next episode, then I'll lose interest fairly fast.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Back to the whole "it's a product of its time" argument, however. I feel it's in Ocarina of Time, Half Life and Final Fantasy 7 territory, when you compare it to video games because of that. It's regarded so highly because for its time it would've been groundbreaking but nowadays it's just... I mean, it's enjoyable. There's some parts of this anime that were so ahead of its time, especially in terms of aesthetics, the fusion of futuritistic and antiquated scenery, and use of Western tropes. It also, given its age, has fairly decent LGBT representation, which is rare for anime nowadays, even.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The thing is, we're in 2018 now and there's been so many Japanese shows since that have given their take on Western tropes, that it just doesn't hold up when you separate it from its roots and its place as a piece of anime history. You can't entirely separate the show from its roots, however, because of how much it influenced its successors. This leaves me in an awkward position where as a standalone anime, I don't particularly care for it either way, but I have to also look at it in the grand scheme of things.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This led me down the path of realising that I probably would've liked this show a lot more if I'd have watched it, say 10 years ago when I was growing up. I'd have had less to compare it to back then. Then I remembered I said something similar in my Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt review, and it was at that point that it hit me that the point in which you consume a piece of media, not just in terms of your age, but in terms of the actual point in time, affects your judgement on said media. This can really sway how you perceive things. I think this was the major issue I had with Cowboy Bebop, and this is why I say it really is a product of its time, which to me personally, has not aged particularly well.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I'd last of all like to add, however, I'm not really the target demographic of this show, being a woman in my 20s. If I was a young adult man, finding myself and growing up, I feel this show would've done a lot more for me and generally been more interesting.

            Story: 8/10
            <br>
             <br/>
             A Series that was made in the late 90s and looking at that time where the anime was made, it had a quite interesting and nice story. The anime haves the old style of airing episodes, where almost every episode is for itself, just like in marvel shows.
             <br/>
             Every single episode was really great in its own way. Some are really funny, some are sad and some are just epic and interesting. The cowboy + space combination was really great if you ask me. I totally enjoyed the story and was really sad because there wasn't more and not everything was explained. That is actually
             <span id="review185956" style="display: none;">
              the only reason why i give it a 8 out of 10.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters 9/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters in this anime are really great, not because they are "cool" or something. I'm talking about the different kinds of characters they made, and all of them special on their own and all them together make the perfect combination. The balance between funny/cool/sad and and and was perfect. I only wish i could learn more about every character, cause their individual story and past is such touching.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Music: 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Giving it a 10 because i'm a huge Jazz/Blues/Metal fan and this anime had all of it. I was thinking that such music couldn't fit that great with anime, but it really can, and this anime is the proof for it.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Animation: 9/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It was made in the 90's and for that, it had animations that are really nice made, from the movement of the characters to the fighting scenes and the surroundings, the space and the nature...it was all really nice to see and watch.
              <br/>
              I respect them for making it with such quality even back then.

            Since being a critic means writing tons of words, people often think of us as pretentious assholes who can’t have fun. Some critics swallow that crap and then write meaningless bullcrap instead of admitting they enjoyed a stylish, flashy story. The easiest way to recognize it is when a series is said to be about ‘existentialism’. That’s so general, but so useful. After all, that stream of philosophy is huge and you can insert anything into it.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Since I don’t care about my image, I’m not going to claim Cowboy Bebop is about ‘existentialism’ when I can’t back it up. I have no shame in admitting
             <span id="review224003" style="display: none;">
              I love a story that’s all about flash, action and amusing characters. That’s what Cowboy Bebop is and it’s proof that mere storytelling is an art too. There are a few touching moments and the last episodes push for something more profound, but until then there isn’t any depth. Why should it have any when “Mushroom Samba” is one of the best anime episodes ever?
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Watanabe taglined the show as “a new genre unto itself” and later called it an exaggeration. That’s like the fastest runner in the world saying he’s slow. Cowboy Bebop never runs out of steam or ideas. It always has a wide-eyed sense of wonder and always excited what other stories it can tell. Many of the tropes are recognizable, but nothing is a missed chance.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The approach is akin to a band that tries a new genre with every song. People who complain about the episodic nature miss the point. The series has a wider reach than nearly every anime out there. Pretty much every episode is a whole different genre. The characters and art style are the same, but even the color schemes change. “Mushroom Samba” and “Cowboy Funk” are experiments with Comedy and have brighter colors. “Toys in the Attic” experiments with horror and is noticeably darker.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Even pacing and side-character design changes. The aforementioned “Mushroom Samba” has far wackier character design than “Speak Like a Child”, one of the more introspective episodes. The series doesn’t simply borrow a lot from Western fiction but distills it to one show. It had mass appeal because it had a wide reach – whoever you are, there’s something to like her.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Convincing the viewer that the world in your anime exists is difficult. Calling things ‘realistic’ or ‘unrealistic’ isn’t enough, since you first have to know what reality is (or, more correctly, how people perceive reality). The solid blocks don’t define reality. Spaceships and cities on the moon aren’t automatically ‘unrealistic’. If you told people from 1000 years ago that anime will exist they’ll think you’re possessed by a devil.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Reality and real life go deeper than this. Reality is, among things, confusing and has a lot of sides. If it didn’t we wouldn’t need to create art. The most realistic anime are the most far-reaching ones. An anime is more realistic the more it can contain different moods and different people. It doesn’t matter whether you live as a drifter or in a small community – life has all kinds of things going for it.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The show has bounty hunters in space, loud gunfights and a failed experiment that learned to fly. It’s still more realistic – and thus more alive than most anime out there. The variety in mood and texture of the events brings it to life. I couldn’t imagine a show having a fat balloon assassin feeling realistic.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The cast is also a prime example of how to have an ensemble. Spike isn’t the main character. They’re all are. Their personalities aren’t simply different but connected, there is chemistry here. Jet isn’t just a contrast to Spike’s apathy, but a more warm figure for the damaged Faye and the young Ed. Spike’s apathy and cockiness is what puts him at odds with Faye but their greed is what they share and what unites them. Ed herself is a sun in the group of depressed individuals. The characters don’t act out of convenience but on their inner drives, and each of their reactions is uniquely theirs.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Variety itself isn’t enough, of course. You need more than the basics of having different episodes with different styles and moods. The narratives are always tightly focused. The world is full of great anime, but few deserve the award of ‘no useless shots’. Except for the plot-heavy episodes (which don’t really work anyway), every shot equals progress.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It’s worth noting that Cowboy Bebop isn’t a dialogue-heavy show. It borrowed this from the film noire genre. Unlike noire’s bad side, Bebop doesn’t rely on dark shots to let you things are dark. Rather, it doesn’t use a lot of dialogue because it doesn’t need to. The shots are informative enough, and so are never boring.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The series’ only flaw is the grand story behind it focusing on Spike’s past. The series doesn’t exactly lose focus, but confidence. Up until then the defining trait was elegance. Everything was small, but it was enough that counted for a lot. Suddenly we have this huge backstory of broken hearts and smoking guns and overthrowing a criminal syndicate. The last two episodes, while having decent actions, end up mostly as a collection of serious dialogue and dark staring. It survives only on the show’s natural charm. This is one route that demanded a whole new way of storytelling. It’s nice of Watanabe to try but it didn’t work.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is a great anime not because it’s philosophical, influential or borrows a lot from Western fiction. It’s brilliant because it’s a masterpiece of pure storytelling. There are no useless parts in these 23 or so episodes. Each story is different both in events, pacing and mood. People who are uncomfortable with this will make stuff up about ‘existentialism’ but it’s their loss. Regardless of who you are, there’s something to enjoy here.

            After watching first episode, I thought this is just another episodic animes, which doesn't have any relation with one another. But it wasn't. It will take you by surprise, by how the story travels, how the characters relate, how the story is or the best of all, how the awesome sound gels with the story and give it a high value. I prefer this to any anime newcomer and I don't deny it will take them as a surprise.

             The first few episodes you will feel like, is there any story at all. But I bet, it is, and damn what a story it is.
             <span id="review183936" style="display: none;">
              At first glance, it is just another bounty hunter in alternate universe, but it so much more than that. And it is hard to explain without giving spoilers, so I contain myself not to reveal, but it is one hell of a story.

              I was quite awestruck with the art style. Can't believe it came a decade ago, but nonetheless, it is refreshing. It is far better than lot of crap, that is being aired these days.

              One of the best OST in anime,I have ever heard. Don't go by my Anime List, I have heard a lot and it is easily one of the best. I seriously doubt this show would have received such accolades if not for the OST.

              Characters are unique yet not so hard to understand. Each of the have nice back story which unfold over time. And all of them all excellent and it cruise along with the story. It compliments the story and does great job.

              Damn, this anime has everything. Humor, Action and what not. I thoroughly enjoyed it and except a couple of filler episodes, I was totally blasted away with the show. I binge-watched the show after certain episode. as I couldn't wait any longer. It is seriously addictive.

            Short Review: (I know, I know, I gave Cowboy Bebop less than a 10/10) Almost everything about this anime is of extremely high quality, especially considering we're talking about an anime that's more than 15 years old. Pitch-perfect English dub, a vast bout incredible OST, unique characters, and incredibly fluid animation. HOWEVER. I did not expect an episodic story, and this led me to almost hate the anime at times.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Looooooooong review:
             <br/>
             Story:
             <br/>
             Before watching this anime, my expectations for Cowboy Bebop were astronomically high, pun somewhat intended. Having known this cult classic's reputation, I was sorely disappointed to find out Cowboy Bebop is an episodic
             <span id="review165281" style="display: none;">
              series, something that was conveniently left out in every review I had come across (I don't really like episodic shows). I was expecting this epic space opera tale filled with drama and complex characters, which Bebop only fully delivered the latter. A lot of this anime's story goes something like, "There's a new bounty on a criminal!" "Let's catch him/her!" Stuff goes wrong, fights ensue, then things look up, the problem is (somewhat) solved, and in the end, the crew gets (almost) nothing. Episodes that do not involve trying to catch a criminal usually involve the antics of one of the crew members, something which the writers must have had a lot of fun coming up with. Occasionally, some other stuff is sprinkled in, mostly involving someone/thing from one of the crew's past. This is where the main theme of the show comes in, as every crew member gets at least 1 episode dealing with their past and how they handle it. This method of storytelling left much to desired from me, because for every great and very enjoyable episode, there was one that made me feel very annoyed and facepalm a lot. And there were only about 10 "plot" episodes in the whole series. However, the anime did keep me interested by ending the episodes in a way that most people wouldn't expect. This was probably the most interesting part of the show. The narrative of Cowboy Bebop does not ever do the "info dump" many sci-fi series are guilty of. Because of this, the writing may seem "masterful" but for me, a few times I spent the first few minutes of an episode wondering just what was going on. Once again, maybe I just wasn't "mature enough" for this anime. Cowboy Bebop makes the unique genres of Space Western and Neo-Noir work together exceedingly well, which is probably what contributed to this anime's popularity. As for the ending, I don't think I could have written a better ending to this anime. It's just one of those where it lightly hangs in the air, waiting for its full effect to sink in. It felt like everything was tied up in the story, but not in the "fast-forward" way others shows end.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters:
              <br/>
              I do give praise to the characters in Cowboy Bebop, as every one of them is unique and not lazily written. They all have their deep motivations for why they do what they do, and it's usually isn't a cliche reason. The best part about this is as you see more about the characters, it becomes more interesting to watch their dynamic, them growing and reacting to their surroundings, because everyone is so non-cliche. Every member of the Bebop crew is very likable and has a fleshed-out personality, with Spike being effortlessly smooth and cool, Jet being a (reluctant) voice of reason, Faye being the strong female lead with no romantic feelings for Spike (shocker), and Ed being ridiculously enigmatic and childish, but never annoying. Even Ein had his moments of being very necessary to what was going on throughout this anime. It's because everyone aboard the Bebop is so different from one another, this rag-tag team feeling did push the story into many great moments and episodes. They highlight each other's flaws, but also make each other stronger, despite all their bickering. Secondary characters are usually in only one episode each, because this is an episodic series. Characters siding with our protagonists usually change by the end of an episode, and the "bad guys" were all unique, mostly memorable, and fun to watch get chased down by the Bebop crew. The real bad guys, Vicious and the Red Dragon syndicate, made interesting antagonists, despite their roots in western movie cliches. They were threatening, but not enough that it becomes the focus of the show. All the character designs were both unique and creative, which brings me to my next point...
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art:
              <br/>
              I really do have to tip my hat (if I was wearing one right now) to the art style of this anime. It's very 90's, while having its own unique style. Yes, it very much looks like anime, but the style is also westernized, blending the two in a beautiful harmony. The one thing that Cowboy Bebop really left an impression on me is that the art (actually, most of this anime) is undeniably stylish and unique. I really loved how all the sci-fi elements looked gritty and realistic, while the aspects closer to present-day were incredibly detailed, almost as if the animators took real buildings and setting and transformed them into anime. The art perfectly blends the western and sci-fi elements in a way I would have thought would never have worked.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Animation:
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is one of the last anime series to be made entirely by traditional cel animation, drawing each and every single frame by hand. But for it's time, the animation is incredibly fluid and consistent throughout the entire series, something which was a problem for other shows using the same animation method (cough Evangelion cough). Heck, I'd even say the animation quality of Cowboy Bebop is equal to, if not greater than some of the stuff that's being made today, 16 years later. All the action is as effortless as Spike's fighting style, and the animators took great care in making sure everything in this anime looked realistic, somewhat gritty, and absolutely amazing. Only very few clips of recycled animation were used, and the only ones I can think of are when the Bebop flies through hyperspace and those yellow gates. Clearly Cowboy Bebop had a large budget, and it was used to its full potential by not skimping on animation.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Voice:
              <br/>
              This is a no-brainer, but I say watch Cowboy Bebop dubbed. Part of the reason this anime is so famous here in the west is because of its amazing dub. While it actually took me a few episodes to get used to the voices, especially when a new member of the crew was introduced, the dub quickly grew on me, but did did hit a few bumps in the road here and there. Steve Blum is probably most well known for playing Spike, and the same can be said about Wendee Lee playing Faye. All the voice actors clearly had a lot of fun dubbing this, and they gave it their all and it payed off. The script is witty, the delivery for all the actors was (95% of the time) pitch-perfect, and added to the style and overall feel of the anime. The dub just feels so much more stylish, while reading subs usually just give you the raw translation. With a western prime audience in mind, Bandai made sure this dub was of the best quality, and it is one that is considered the best dubs in all of anime. Even Shinichiro Watanabe, the Japanese director, says the English dub is better.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Music:
              <br/>
              The opening theme, "Tank!" has lent itself to be one of the most iconic anime openings of all time, being a) instrumental and b) as stylish and jazzy as the rest of the show. In case the title of this anime didn't clue you in, almost the entire soundtrack is inspired from jazz or classic western movie music. Even some of the episode names are classic American rock songs (Bohemian Rhapsody) or albums (Toys in the Attic). Yes, this does lend this anime "cool" points, but the sheer number of tracks in the OST (93!!!) means that you won't hear a lot of them very often. There are a few exceptions, like the music box theme whenever Spike's past came up. Some songs are slow, some are quick, some are sad, and some are kinda goofy. Yoko Kanno has proven that she can compose a completely amazing soundtrack, and this is one of her most famous works. The first ending theme actually wasn't that impressive, but the second ending theme, used only for the last episode, had my mouth gaping open by how it matched the tone of the show's ending perfectly. It very much reminded me of "The World of Midnight" from Black Lagoon.

              Execution:
              <br/>
              I failed to recognize while I was watching this anime that it was designed to appeal to a western audience with its episodic storytelling and not being like typical anime of the time. While most seasoned anime fans and critics regard Cowboy Bebop as a "cult classic," the two words I would use to describe this anime are stylish and westernized. I don't think Cowboy Bebop necessarily failed, I just went in with the wrong mindset and impressions of the show. In other words, Cowboy Bebop's reputation precedes itself, but not by a long shot. Sure, this anime passes style with flying colors, but it seemed to me at first to lack the meat and potatoes, aka an overarching rich story. But I am one to agree this would make a good (but not the best) first anime and a great way to get fathers or brothers into anime.

              My Enjoyment:
              <br/>
              Because I went into this anime with such high expectations, my enjoyment was hindered very much so. As I clicked on the next episode, I kept telling myself, "Okay, this is it. We're actually going to see some overarching plot or an entertaining episode." only to be disappointed 25 minuted later. I'm a bit hesitant to call this anime "overrated," but again, I just think my problem was that I went into this show with the wrong mindset. Sure, there were plenty of entertaining episodes, but there were more that had disappointed or just made me feel weird (not in the good way). The creativity involved for the more slice-of-life episodes is remarkable, but I can't help but feel a sort of grudge against this anime for "letting me down." Sure, I could go back and watch this series again (with the proper mindset) but I think my enjoyment of this series was ruined from the moment I caught wind of this anime's extreme reputation. Cowboy Bebop is the kind of anime to just pick up an episode or two, kick back, and relax. Enjoy the memorable characters, creative episodes, vast soundtrack, and the excellent dub. But don't watch it because "You're not a real anime fan if you haven't seen Cowboy Bebop hurrr hurrr." That is NEVER a good reason to watch an anime, and if anyone says something like that to you, tell them to shut up.

            ~No Spoiler~
            <br>
             <br/>
             The storyline is great.
             <br/>
             If you want to know if you're going to like Cowboy Bebop, I suggest to watch the first 4 episodes, they are a small introducing to the rest to the series.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The story is about a space cowboy named spike, he is a bounty hunter on the ship the bebop. Together with Faye and Jet he collects bounty's, this isn't going that well all the time, therefore Cowboy bebop has a lot of humor, unlike most anime.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The episodes selves are all different stories in one storyline, that's what makes Cowboy bebop unique. Every episode has got a lot of action
             <span id="review187436" style="display: none;">
              in it, so it'll never bore you! It's really different from the other anime, but it's still good.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              All characters in the Bebop has his own backstory, which all get's unraveled during the series.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I really enjoyed watching this serie and I highly suggest you to watch it.
              <br/>
              It has everything, again! Action, a bit romance, depression, humor and even horror (it's my opionon of horror ;))
              <br/>
              So if you want a good anime, I suggest this one.

            There are only two anime series/OVA/movie I've seen.  Cowboy Bebop and Fullmetal Alchemist are the only ones.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop follows Spike, Jet, Faye and Edward as bounty hunters aboard the spaceship Bebop.  Now onto the many reasons why this anime series is perfect.

             First the story:  Which blends comedy, drama, action, adventure, Sci-fi and even some romance perfectly like no other show.  Most of the series are one episode stories yet I think are all connected in the development of the characters.  The story of each individual episode is done perfectly giving a beginning a middle and end with no lose ends.
             <span id="review2766" style="display: none;">
              The action is brilliant and I still haven't seen anything to compare to it.  Finally we have the last few episodes leading to the ending.  I won't give anything away to the people who unfortunately haven't seen this series, just it will blow you away.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Second the characters:  Again done perfectly.  Each character has their own unique personality who grows as the show goes along.  Spike who used to work for Red Dragon crime organization and his haunted by his past.  Jet a former police officer who is now working with a criminal, and his haunted by the mistake he made in the past.  Faye who awakes from a 54 year cryogenic sleep with no memory of her past, who lives for the moment.  Finally Edward a eccentric computer genius, who ran away from her father.  Each character brings life to the series and draws you in caring about what happens to each of them.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Third the animation:  The animation done by Sunrise is simply brilliant, and is still amazing after 10 years.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Forth the soundtrack:  The music to the series is the perhaps the greatest soundtrack to anime series ever.  It has a little of everything from Rock, classic, Jazz, Heavy Metal and others.  Each adding something extra to the series.  I even have the soundtrack to the series
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Fifth the Influence:  Cowboy Bebop has Influenced many series much like Trigun.  Shows like BLACK LAGOON, SAMURAI CHAMPLOO, and others.  I think that's a great compliment.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall Cowboy Bebop is a perfect anime series and is must to any anime fan.

            The nonchalant Spike, The righteous Jet, The sneaky Faye, and witty Edward....
            <br>
             <br/>
             These beloved characters have in-printed themselves onto my heart slowly but surely.
             <br/>

             CowBoy Bebop is an anime that was recommended to me by various sources. Knowing that the anime was about 14 years old, I was hesitant to start it up. Eventually, with the consistent nagging of my buddies and fellow anime fan, I started Cowboy Bebop.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Took me three days to marathon it, and boy what a ride it was!!
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Story:
             <br/>
             <br/>
             There only has been a few animes that were in a “episodic” style that I really enjoyed. Mushi shi was one, xxxholic was another, and I
             <span id="review126053" style="display: none;">
              guess we can count Tsubasa chronicles as another. Besides those cherished anime, I have been left unimpressed by that style of storytelling. Little did I know that cowboy Bebop was the revolutionary anime that introduced this style to the animation world. Not only did it introduced, but it was executed perfectly most of the time.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              There were episodes that I could have done without, some of the earlier episodes to be specific, and few random episodes in the mid section of the anime. This is not a problem since most the episodes were great and done a very aesthetically pleasing manner.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The story in these episodes were less about plot and more about characters. These mini stories helped us understand and get to know the main characters in a unique manner. Nothing was handed to us, we had to decipher a lot of their backstory episode by episode, and we had to piece the stories ourselves.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In the end, however, everything came in a crash, and the entirety of these small plots came into a flashy dystopic climax!
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art/Animation:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The animation was flawless. Even without considering that this a show made 14 years ago, I was thoroughly impressed with the fluidity of every episodes. All of the fighting sequences left me breathless, and kept me at the edge of my feet!
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The character designs reminded me a lot of Samurai Champloo...and I was pleasantly surprised to read that there are of similar origins, same director.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I will add that this anime, out of all the animes that I've watched so far, had the greatest amount of diversity in terms of characters. It was not all just Japanese people who conquered and repopulated the universe but also Indians, Arabs, Africans, and Americans ( thinking of a certain cowboy hehehe)
              <br/>
              I really enjoyed seeing this diversity because that is more representative of how the world actually is.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              A lot of anime directors nowdays should take not of how to budget and direct these episodes, CB showed the way. This is how you get it done guys!
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Just like every anime review that I do, I stress the importance of sound/bgm as a contributor of the making of a masterpiece. Without a great accompany soundtrack, an anime cannot be called a masterpiece in my eyes. Sound sets the atmosphere faster than any of the senses that we have. It is of the utmost importance to have the best compatible soundtrack.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              CowBoy Bebop doesn't disappoint on this end either. The soundtrack is strong. It is a mixture of different sounds from the sixties, a lot of jazzy records, and soothing blues. The soundtrack really contributes to the effects that CB is portraying, the smoothness of Spike, the sneakiness of Faye, and the tough righteousness of Jet are all represented well through the music. There are couple of pieces that I will later try to find for personal enjoyment. Really smooth soundtrack.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This anime is made by and for the characters. We don't have any ingenious plot line, or any non-fulfilling fan service...what we have is plenty of character development. Obviously, this is going to be the biggest part of the review since I will discuss in detail my opinion of each character.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Edward:      Is this a person a girl or a boy? The ambiguity of her gender plagued my thoughts throughout the show. Anytime I was convinced that she was a girl, someone would come along and challenge those beliefs. In all practicality, she was probably a girl. I really expected a lot from her when she was introduced, she seemed witty and smart, but also caring. She, however, did not live up to my expectations, probably becoming the least of the main characters in CB.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Faye:     I didn't enjoy her at first. She seemed too snotty for her own good. Usually characters of her type bring nothing but randomness and chaos to a story line, and I've never been a fan of that. She did surprise me around mid series however. She was a lot more deep than what I gave her credit for. Without delving into any spoilers, I found myself empathizing with her emotional distraught about her past life and ended up becoming a big fan of hers. I wish that she would have had more episodes where she was a bit more honest with her feelings, the tough girl act can only take you so far, but due to the 26 episode limit, I was thoroughly satisfied by the end with this character's development.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Jet:         My favorite character of the series. Jet is a balding middle age gentleman with a huge biceps and a big personality to follow along with it. At first, I thought he was going to stay one dimensional, usually characters of his type are not examined enough in anime, but again CB surprised me by giving me a glimpse of who Jet was in the past, and some of his reasoning. We saw him grow as he finally decided to not look to the past anymore, and I related a lot with that. A lot of the time, in my personal life, I've been tied to the past, whether it was a past version of myself, a past friend, a past job or school...a past lover....I found myself always looking back and reminiscing and it hasn't been until recently that I decided to put the past where it belongs, learn from it, and strive for the future. I love Jet because his development is an incarnation of the feelings that I've also developed. His friendship with Jet was unorthodox but really enjoyable to see. Sometimes, the people with opposite personalities find ways to become the closest of friends. Their constant bickering was like classical music to my ears, and their silence was brutally sad. They seemed to be really good at synchronizing with each other.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Spike:         The main character of the show, and the man with few words. Spike is a really interesting character because of his nonchalant attitude. It is really enjoyable to see him in action, he is so smooth in his fighting style that you are surprised by his efficiency. He is one smooth mamajama. His story intrigued me the most, I was really curious to know what his relationship to Julia was and why she was so important. Unfortunately, by the end, I didn't see why Julia was so important. It could have been better to maybe have separate episodes with just her, so we could understand better and empathize with who she was. Maybe it wasn't the director's intent for us to understand Julia but rather understand the emotional connection that Spike had with her. If that is the case, then yes, I did get that Spike really loved her...to the point that he would have died a thousand times to be with her. Spike was always indifferent to most situations, but any time Vicious, and Julia was mentioned he would go into ape mode or get moody. Nothing is wrong with that, but I would have liked further knowledge about that story line. I think if I rewatched the series, I would not recall these issues. All in all, I do like Spike as a character, he's funny, witty, and a good person at heart. A classy main character.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Side characters: Most of the side characters were just introduced and left in the same episode, very few carried over to other episode, and I guess that's the point of the episodic format. CB really did a good job of fleshing out these characters during the one shot episodes and making them deep and relatable. This wasn't achieved in all of the episodes, but it was well done in most.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoyment:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The episodes that I enjoyed....I enjoyed to its fullest extent, but the ones that I didn't like were really a drag. Those dragging episodes though were mostly in the first ten episodes. Overall, I really enjoyed the anime.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I originally gave this anime an 8/10, which is a decent grade, but after taking into consideration the time period when this anime was made, I cannot downgrade the effort and care that was put into making it. I boosted it up to an 9/10...aren't I merciful? :) haha
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Well, the anime wasn't the masterpiece that people made it out to be, I came in with super high expectations, but this was a great anime. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I recommend anyone with a normal concentration span to try CowBoy Bebop out.

            Let Cowboy Bebop serve as an example of why I consider praise for a series to be a spoiler in and of itself. For decades I have heard nothing but exaltation for Cowboy Bebop, and in the face of that kind of overwhelming critical and cult acclamation... it's hard not to be disappointed. If someone leads you to believe you will have your mind blown and your life changed, anything less makes the whole thing feel like they've made you put on a damp sweater.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Maybe Cowboy Bebop is best considered within a particular social timeframe and cultural mindset. Maybe Cowboy Bebop is great because
             <span id="review259715" style="display: none;">
              of the effect it had on a genre. Because I came to Cowboy Bebop almost two-decades late, however, none of that can bear upon my review of it. I can only review it as I experienced it. This is to say, I thought Cowboy Bebop was on the high side of okay.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I like the characters. They're fun, they're interesting, they have some depth (but not a lot of growth). I like the world and the setting. The series passed the time. That's kind of where it ends for me. Perhaps it's a matter of taste, but I'm not very interested in episodic, short-term story telling and I wish that there'd been a series-long arc covering the dealings with the Syndicate to tie everything together. As it is, each episode is just a cast of characters doing a bunch of random crap and remaining unchanged as a result. This kind of storytelling is deeply dissatisfying for me--there's a reason why serialized dramas are ruling TV these days and why self-contained procedural dramas don't win awards.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Ultimately, I was disappointed that Cowboy Bebop didn't strive to do more, to BE more, given the perfect cast, setting, and set-up for an engaging high-concept story. Bebop is a series that is better discovered at random--late night on TV or on a shelf in a 00's video store--than it is discovered due to its acclaim. It's better experienced for what it is than for what it could or should have been.

            The Music: Jazz, blues, acoustic ballads, hard rock, country funk. Yoko Kannos' work is pure genius.(You might also be aware of her work from The Ghost in shell series)
            <br>
             <br/>
             From the opening theme song "Tank", to chase sequence music such as "Bad Dog No Biscuit", to "Space lion" or the awesome "What planet is this?". The music is pitch perfect and suits the setting of the anime elegantly.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The Characters: Cowboy Bebop's characters are as realistic a one can get. What is great about the series is that it maintains the mortality of main characters. This team is not a bunch of all powerful god like super-humans
             <span id="review129169" style="display: none;">
              who can kick anyone's ass simply by their "will power"   (Goku..cough cough..Naruto cough cough...Shonen cough cough)
              <br/>
              This team is all too real, they have their problems, they can be overpowered and they can die.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The Voice Actors: I have never seen another anime which compares to the same level of English dub as this this series, okay maybe Baccano!
              <br/>
              The voice actors used have done a really really good job. I just cannot picture Spike Spiegel without Steve Blums' voice in my head.
              <br/>
              I mean really, one of the best dubs evaaarr.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The Bruce Lee element: Chances are you find Spike Spiegel's fighting style jaw-dropping awesome. Have you ever wondered what what type of style is that?
              <br/>
              It's Jeet Kun do which "is an electric/hybrid style of no style and philosophy of life founded by martial artist [The great]Bruce Lee."
              <br/>
              <br/>
              That is not the best part. Not only is Spike practitoner of Jeet Kun Do but also follows Bruce Lee's philosophy of life.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Noir-CyperPunk-SpaceWestern: Holy shit, this anime has all three of them. The technology depicted in the anime is fascinating probably because it still uses wires which gives it an interesting aspect because we all know the future will be nothing like that.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Humor: Cowboy Bebop is anything if not funny. The classic Spike and Jet situations are very humorous. Not only that, the recurring characters such as the three old men, and Punch and Judy from the T.V show Big Shot can put a smile to anyone's face.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              For me Cowboy Bebop has evolved beyond as an anime. It is a culture.

            A fantastic show that defines the space western genre but is let down by mediocre character development and a rushed ending pretending to be deep when in reality, is just premature.  Watch episodes 1 through 23 while skipping Jupiter Jazz part 1 and 2, and then watch the movie as a finale, you'll finish the show feeling much more fulfilled instead of let down. The characters throughout the show fail to arc meaningfully or form any bonds otherwise. The entire ending of the show could've been drastically improved is the characters could follow a path of reason. Its hard to describe the short comings
            <span id="review316041" style="display: none;">
             of the show without spoiling its better parts. It really is a great work of early anime but I wholeheartedly recommend avoiding Spike's plot line.

              Story: 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The story is set in a Space/Western genre. Cowboy Bebop follows an episodic adventure of Spike and Jet on a ship called the Bebop. Episodic anime tend to get repetitive and boring, but Cowboy Bebop is an exception. There's a solid continuity, too. The film noir, which includes characters smoking cigarettes, witty banter and a gun being shot in almost every episode, makes the anime feel more American, which I like. Little to no background information is given about any of the characters from
              <span id="review337025" style="display: none;">
               the beginning. Each character has a past that is hidden throughout many episodes. Slowly, the audience learns of the sins and tragedies that quietly haunt those aboard the spaceship of Bebop. Cowboy Bebop also tackles serious subjects like existentialism and the realization that we are all completely alone.
               <br/>

               Art: 10/10
               <br/>
               <br/>
               After two decades, the animation looks amazing. Sunrise generally does a good job at animation and they nailed this one. The art of Bebop is truly something special. The animation during the numerous action sequences is especially impressive and the character movements are free-flowing and naturalistic. Some of the animation is outdated, but I feel that it adds to the art. Like aged cheddar, Cowboy Bebop's animation is old but gold.

               <br/>
               Like or hate this anime, but the OST is amazing. So amazing that without the music I believe that Cowboy Bebop would never have achieved the success it has had to this day. Never have I come across another example such as Cowboy Bebop where the music is such an integral part of the show. From the Blues to the unmatched soul of harmonica solos, the music in Cowboy Bebop does its job 110%. To say that the the music is fitting would be an understatement. Cowboy Bebop's music boosts the atmosphere and situation of every scene to its highest potential and provides a convincing atmosphere like no other. The English dub is so amazing that even Shinichiro Watanabe himself, as well as the Japanese cast, prefers the dub. Each character is portrayed brilliantly and every word is rich with human emotion.

               <br/>
               <br/>
               Cowboy Bebop has one of the most memorable casts of any show I have ever watched. They are eccentric, unique, strong willed, and powerfully convincing. Spike Spiegel is a bounty hunter who tries to escape an inescapable past. Jet Black is the father like figure of the spaceship Bebop who has been stricken by unjust tragedies. I like other characters such as Faye Valentine, Ed and Ein.

               I've seen a lot of anime, and Cowboy Bebop is most definitely one of my favorites. I'll probably see a lot more anime and still think that Bebop is one of my favorites. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry. It'll make you think. it'll make you feel. It's untouchable. It's ice cold. It's a classic.
