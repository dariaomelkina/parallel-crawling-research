            I know what your thinking a six for Cowboy Beebop how could you? Well I'm sorry, but it was just a six out of ten anime for me. I don't think it was a waste of my time but I didn't really like it either. The characters are good and interesting but they don't really interact, they don't really change all that much and they don't get satisfying ends to their character arcs. Some of the episodes are certainly interesting, but a lot of them are pretty dry, and the lack of an overarching plot thread and the lack of progress between episodes means that
            <span id="review301603" style="display: none;">
             it can get pretty boring and repetitive.
             <br>
              <br/>
              Spike's mysterious backstory never really becomes interesting and neither does his rival whose name and appearance make him seem far to much like a character who doesn't realize he's in the wrong anime, which makes it really hard to take the rivalry seriously. It doesn't help that his rival has a personality almost as mysterious as his backstory, and yet were supposed to take his and Spike's rivalry very seriously.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The opening is of course amazing and the fights are very well animated. As I said it wasn't bad but when someone was talking about how good it was and asked me to back them up, I simply found myself going wellll. It's a 6/10 for me.

            “You told me once to forget the past, cause it doesn’t matter, but you’re the one still tied to the past, Spike.”-- Faye Valentine
            <br>
             <br/>
             This one dialogue perfectly encapsulates everything that Cowboy Bebop is. It’s a struggle between trying to break the shackles of the past yet the more you walk forward the more you realize that you are just falling deeper into the pit of your own past because despite your better judgement, you are what your past defines you to be. Sometimes we can break this paradox and free ourselves from the past but most of us are just stuck on this endless loop
             <span id="review332475" style="display: none;">
              of the regrets of our earlier days.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is set in a futuristic western setting that is clearly inspired by Western pop-culture. This is very evident from the homage that Bebop pays to the likes of Sergio Leone’s classic The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and the Bruce Lee inspired fight choreography in the very first episode. We follow the journey of two space bounty hunters, Spike and Jet. They try to catch criminals in space and earn reward for their hardwork. After awhile they get two more crews, Faye and Edward. Faye is a sexy yet problematic woman who is always on debt due to her rather unusual spending and Edward is a young computer genius. Their crew is also joined by Pembroke Welsh Corgi named Ein. Since Cowboy Bebop is an episodic show it predictably has a repeating formula. They do a mission, cause a lot of commotion and damage and once they go to collect their bounty they realize that the cost of the damage outweighs their bounty prize. So, basically they return to square one.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This is why I don’t like episodic shows yet Bebop despite it’s repeating formula stands out. This is because these repeated acts are not due to the writer’s inability to have creative assertion but they explore each character and their belief with great subtlety and care. A beautiful example of this is showcased on the very first episode. Both Spike and Jet witnesses a tragic end between two lovers but despite this, they both move on with the weight of this tragedy on their shoulder not holding them back. They have seen enough to know how cruel the world is and they know not to form any connection to people when everyone is trying to better one another. This is where the beautiful tragedy of Cowboy Bebop begins. Since this is a spoiler free review I won’t point out the specifics but watch Spike and Jet’s behavior towards the end of Episode 24. An ingenious reversal of how they were able to break free of that weight when they were not attached and how human attachment suddenly changes everything.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              What truly separates Cowboy Bebop from every other show of this similar style is it’s characters. Each character is beautifully well designed with unique attributes to remember them. The back and forth between Bebop’s crew is one of the shows outer charm but what lies inside is the intrigue of their past and the decisions that made them who they are today. Unlike most stories, they don’t dump their story in one episode and be done with it. No, they carefully weave their characteristics with every episode. They gives us bits and pieces and even before their eventual reveal, we already know them enough to know how their past shaped them and how they shaped their past.  By the end, everything beautifully falls into place as these characters chooses their path when they are standing at the crossroads of letting the sleep of your past drag you deeper into your dream or to wake up.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It’s mesmerizing to witness these characters finally reaching their own resolve with their broken past and chose their own redemption. Some make the right choice and some don’t but this is how life is.

              Cowboy Bebop essentially has everything. It has the perfect start that sets up the preceding events beautifully, it has the perfect story midpoint in Jupiter Jazz Part 1&amp;2 and it has one of the finest ending of the medium in The Real Folk Blues Part 1&amp;2. On top of all that, it has what is highly regarded as one of the greatest episode in all of anime and what I consider to be my personal favorite episode in anime, Episode 5, Ballad of Fallen Angels. This episode introduces us to the show’s main antagonist, Vicious. It’s a perfect mixture of intrigue and high octane action that sets both Spike and Vicious on a path that they left unburied all those years ago. I have probably seen this episode atleast 50 times yet I can’t grow tired of watching it.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop doesn’t only let it’s narrative define it but it also lets it’s production define it as well. It is easily one of the most well directed tv show to be ever aired. Each episode is filled with magnificent scene composition that lets it’s perfect color shading and detailed background to flourish. One can not believe that this is actually the debut work of Shinichiro Watanabe who went on to make more great shows but none quite as definitive in it’s brilliance as Cowboy Bebop. It is often said that an artist’s first art is what defines them and Watanabe lets Cowboy Bebop’s sheer genius in story telling define and shape his legacy.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Now it can’t be a Cowboy Bebop review without talking about it’s brilliant musical score by the musical genius Yoko Kanno. The musical score of Cowboy bebop is just as important to it’s impressive legacy as it’s narrative brilliance. Yoko Kanno and her band Seatbelts created what is arguably the greatest musical score for a Television show. Each episode is blessed with fantastic tracks that compliments the amazing scene composition of Shinichiro Watanabe. The music mostly focuses on jazz but there is no lack of diversity throughout the soundtrack. The opening, Tank is one of the most recognizable and beloved anime opening ever. The ending track, The Real Folk Blues is a perfect mixture of melancholia and jazz that sets the mood of the show.  Some stand out tracks includes Call Me Call Me, Elm, Space Lion. Every episode of Cowboy Bebop is named after either a famous song or a musical reference.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Now since this is an episodic anime, some episodes are bound to be better than the other ones and some will be weaker compared to the show’s peak. There are no outright bad episode in Cowboy Bebop and even it’s weaker episodes can easily claim to be better than most other anime’s peak points. The particular episodes I am not quite a big fan of are "Toys in the Attic" and "Boogie Woogie Feng Shui". They are by no means bad, it’s just that they are not as good as some of the other episodes.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is a show which wears a mask. The mask is the fun action-packed show with cool dialogues with distinctive western style but what lies underneath the mask is the cruel truth of how we have to carry the weight of our past and move forward, not let that weight slow us down. You can try all you want to not be attached to your regrets but in the end it’s our past that defines us. Some people choose to walk away yet the others let their past sink them until their present reality becomes an extension of their past regrets.

            i'm a tad bit conflicted heading into this review, that's because this is an anime that's one of the of the most popular ones in the west, and what does that mean exactly? praised as if it was bigger than art by numerous professionals strictly connected to media, it has a swarm of fans that will skin you alive if you try as much as to criticize it.
            <br>
             <br/>
             make no mistake, cowboy bebop is a good series but it is lacking to be a masterpiece. and a 7 is a good enough score for it, i believe.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             there is no real plot in the 26 episodes series
             <span id="review300853" style="display: none;">
              that is cowboy bebop, the amount of it is enough to fill up at least half a season, the rest is just dragging it out with multiple scenarios that hold absolutely no correlation with the already small amount of plot and that some 'could' call 'plotline' and the some utterly unnecessary characters. some episodes were easily 10s with how both entertaining and interesting they were but most of them don't go higher than a 5. and the 'most' in this case are episodes that were just pointless.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              why did actual crucial characters like vicious and julia have little to no appearances or additional plot? why did the series add in some characters that nobody cares about and that weren't crucial to plot or characters and their development? the ending was, you could say, satisfying for an ending at least but it feels like i've been going full circle this whole time while i was trying to reach the climax of the show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              objectively, i held this show before and still do hold it in high regard. cowboy bebop is a well-made show and it's definitely worth a watch and what it does excel in is the compelling cast of (main) characters, art for its time (which is good) and the music but my subjective view on it is what will bring masses to tell me how my taste is shit for bringing out the flaws on their favorite anime.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              i wanted a series that would tackle the main characters' pasts (especially spike's) and the characters themselves more than it already did, more from julia and vicious in general, well that was not exactly the case here. good show, not good enough to be a masterpiece.

            I think we can all agree that Cowboy Bebop is a great series based on its tremendous amount of charisma, style, and flair alone. We all know its music, visual style, and setting is legendary. We all know Spike is the coolest character in all of anime and Faye is one of the sexiest, and yet realistically human femme fatales. We all know Ed is one of the most offbeat, unique, and fun characters.
            <br>
             <br/>
             In terms of substance, the show sparse and that's OK, because Cowboy Bebop proves that you don't need to tell some grand, complicated story in order to be considered good; it
             <span id="review327835" style="display: none;">
              is perfectly acceptable to take simple but raw emotions and communicate them with such intensity and precision that the audience is absorbed into the world of the characters. I think a lot of people try to pull some existential meaning from something that they enjoy in order to validate their enjoyment of something, but I don't think that Cowboy Bebop was going for some higher meaning and there's nothing wrong with that. It does discuss the idea of dealing with one’s past, whether that means letting go of it and moving on or being shackled by it, but I personally didn’t find any of its ideas insightful.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Many of the negative reviews point to the show’s lack of attention to its overarching plot as a cause for lack of enjoyment and/or engagement. Once again, not everything has to tie into something bigger for greater significance. Episodic shows succeed by constantly introducing fresh characters and settings and combining these with interesting core characters to craft entertaining stories. There's more freedom to explore the world of the show as well as different sides of the characters this way. That being said, the short duration of the stories being told means that you really have to nail them by making each character, setting, moment, and new idea count or else the stories end up being forgettable. The 22 minute time frame limits the complexity of the stories you can tell, as you have to introduce new characters, new conflicts, and new settings and complete an arc for the characters and resolve said conflicts in the same episode. This leaves little room for error.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So did Cowboy Bebop manage to pull it off, telling memorable stories in each episode with moments so good you can watch them a thousand times over and not get bored? Sometimes, but not always. About half of the episodes fall into the category of "Fun, enjoyable little episode. Onto the next one." While each episode develops the idea of the past, the stories being told aren't particularly original, which is expected since Cowboy Bebop deliberately pulls from a variety of Western sources. What distinguishes Cowboy Bebop is the level of its direction in telling each of these stories. Musical goddess Yoko Kanno's music plays a large part in elevating scenes to greatness, lending vividness to even the simplest of emotions and providing the energy to the action sequences. In many of the episodes, Yoko Kanno's music paired with beautifully composed long shots make for timeless, classic scenes.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In the first episode, there's the scene with the bloody space ship trialing across the sky. In the fifth episode, there's perhaps one of the greatest sequences in animation of all time, incorporating the song "Rain" followed by "Green Bird". Is it trying to convey some deep philosophical idea? I don't think so. Do you feel intimately what Spike is feeling without him saying a word about his past? Yes. In the sixth episode, there's the scene where the kid plays the harmonica. The simplicity of the scene leaves space for the viewer's own thoughts and emotions to fill in the atmosphere, guided by "Spokey Dokey" and "Digging my Potato". Is it saying anything deep? I don't know. Does it make for an engaging and immersive viewing experience? Yes. The same thing goes for episode 12, where a saxophonist plays "Space Lion" as we see Faye drinking away her troubles at the bar. In episode 10, the lazy, nostalgic coast port setting combined with "Waltz for Zizi" is a story all by itself. So many good moments that are powerful in their understated nature.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The problem is that these moments are often embedded in good, but not great stories. Many of the episodes, like "Stray Dog Strut", "Gateway Shuffle", "Toys in the Attic", "Heavy Metal Queen", "Bohemian Rhasphody", "Mushroom Samba", and "Wild Horses" are simply good, not particularly loads of fun or memorable. Perhaps in a longer series with dramatic, long arcs these episodes would be more enjoyable as relaxed reprieves from the tension, but since Cowboy Bebop is episodic with low stakes most of the time, these episodes stand out as unexceptional. Some viewers might just be enthralled by the novelty of the idea behind the episodes themselves (funny dog chase with Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Alien tribute, trans character, blaxploitation tribute, old space shuttle tribute) but for me the execution of these ideas has to be on point as well, and Cowboy Bebop merely channels the things it's tributing but doesn't pack the umph with them. I didn't laugh at "Stray Dog Strut", the villain in "Gateway Shuttle" was bland (since I've seen it too many times before), "Toys in the Attic"'s suspense was alright but could be better, the character in "Heavy Metal Queen" was alright, the blaxplointation characters lacked character in "Mushroom Samba", and "Wild Horses" was simply a slow, relaxing episode. It's not that the barebones framework in these concepts that are bad, but the magic of the influences being drawn from just isn't there.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Besides these episodes, there were several others that were held back because things weren't explained or they weren't explained well enough, perhaps due to the single episode limitation. In "Sympathy for the Devil", it starts out with good mystery, but things are explained way too fast in a load of exposition and the villain has to monologue before Spike for seemingly no reason. Later, he tries to explain his emotions, but it falls flat because the episode is too rushed. This one would've been great as a two-part episode. I understand that the episode is significant for its message that being stuck in the past is like being stuck in time, but I never got the sense as to why it sucks for the villain. In "Ganymede Elegy", Jet's decision towards the end to resolve his emotional conflict didn't make much sense, or perhaps I'm just not getting something. In "Black Dog Serenade" the final showdown between Jet and his rival is underwhelming and the episode ends before we get Jet's reaction to everything that's transpired. According to one interpretation, though, Jet’s reaction is that he tries to move on from his past. In "Speak like a Child" Faye does have an emotional reaction but we never get to see how the revelations change her. It only serves to deepen her tragedy, but personally I wanted her to also realize that she had the potential to become the good person she was before.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In general, although it's better to be understated than to tell too much, I couldn't discern much character development, as you can scramble the episodes and not notice a difference in the characters themselves and their interactions with the other members of the crew. I'm open to opposing thoughts on this, but I don't think it's a coincidence that this problem shows up in Samurai Champloo as well. The only thing that changes is that the characters become slightly more tolerant towards each other. Even so, any bonds they share are quickly torn when they each are so ready to abandon the crew.

              Spike straight up disregards his partnership with Jet and leaves on at least two different occasions for selfish reasons. I get that he's the lone wolf, stubborn type, but still, he won't budge an inch for anyone else when his own interests conflict with the crew's. When Faye tells him not to leave, he doesn't give a damn and walks off. Speaking of Faye, there's no reason shown for why she decides to join up with the crew again after she runs away. Implicitly, it's because of what Gren said to her, but she also doesn't apologize for leaving the crew out to dry. In addition, Jet was only looking for the money she stole and picked her up by coincidence. I get that Cowboy Bebop's style is very macho and people don't talk about their feelings aloud, preferring to leave things unsaid, but at a certain point you need to give me something to hold onto. OK, even if we accept that resolution, later Faye doesn't waste a second high tailing the hell out of the Bebop when she thinks she's found her family, only to come crawling back because the crew is all she has left. I can understand that Faye is selfish and she would leave a second time, but it's the way she left--- she didn't even look back. That doesn't sound like a strong relationship to me. She's just desperate and looking for a home. The same thing goes with Ed. She just gets up and leaves with Ein one day without even bothering to inform the crew face to face. Just like in Samurai Champloo, Watanabe doesn't seem to want his characters to get too close to one another and it baffles me.

              It's a shame, because many of the episodes that I'm lukewarm towards could be substantially improved with great character banter and having the events of the episode actually change the characters, even incrementally. Instead, most of the time the characters work on separate jobs, rarely working together as a team. They talk to each other like coworkers, not as friends, which is fine in the beginning, but not when you're 20 episodes in. It's not really that big of a problem since Watanabe is so good at crafting interesting, charismatic, and yet deeply human characters that feel alive on the screen. The characters are well designed enough that they can get through 26 episodes without much change or bonding, but the show could've been so much better if they didn't just do that. Much of the time Spike does the field work, Faye's doing something else, Jet's the intel guy, and Ed is off doing her own hacking stuff.

              It gets much worse if you watch the dub of Lupin III and realize that Cowboy Bebop's cast is just a pale version of Lupin III's, and the excuse that the characters are stiff with one another because they're not the type to change doesn't fly anymore. Selfish femme fatale with commitment issues? Fujiko pulls that off with much more charisma, sex appeal, and chemistry with men. Straightlaced, stable beard guy? Jigen's the man. Spike doesn't really have a direct analog, as he's nowhere near as silly as Lupin, but the fact remains that the collective chemistry in Lupin III far surpasses that of Cowboy Bebop. Don't believe me? You can just look up the "best of Lupin III dub" on Youtube.

              <br/>
              Yeah, it's a nostalgic show about broken people wandering aimlessly in space, but it seems content in reveling in the cool factor of this state rather than exploring the ways their bonds with each other change them (it does, but it's rather weak, as I mentioned before) or how they try to amend that brokenness. When the ending comes, it feels like Cowboy Bebop just decided to end after a series of fun adventures, rather than as a culmination of events that incrementally lead up to the choices that the characters make to bring about that end. You can say that the characters and ideas are developed around the concept of the past, which is valid, but it seems to me that all of it amounts to, “You can’t forget the past, so you’re going to have to carry that weight.” I don’t see how that’s insightful, as obviously your past is going to weigh on you and it’s impossible to completely forget it and move on. The main problem is that simply talking about the past in general is superficial. People's pasts are different and what matters is exactly what about their unique past the keeps them from moving forward? The question for me is, how do we reconcile with our pasts without letting it drag us down? The answer to this question is unique to each individual and their personal struggles, and it isn't as simple as, "just move on".  With Cowboy Bebop, I was looking for the crew to find new purpose, form a new family, and do something new with their lives. Jet seems to be the only character who has closure on his past because he engages with the reasons for how things turned out the way they did.

              Of course, Spike breaks that family in an attempt to confront his past, which made no sense to me. Spike may be the coolest animated character ever, and effortlessly so, but his edgy death wish attitude is not cool. "I'm not going to die. I'm going to find out if I'm really alive." *Proceeds to go off to die*. It's alright for a character to have this attitude, as Spike has good reason to. The crux of the problem is that I don’t understand how going back and killing a bunch of mobsters and dying because of it provides any type of emotional catharsis. That’s not confronting your past. Confronting your past would be correcting the mistake you made by not repeating it. You can argue Vicious’s rise of power was Spike’s fault and that Spike is going back to prevent Vicious from taking any more lives, but Spike seems to kill Vicious as a symbolic gesture. Dude, you just repeated the same self destructive, violent behavior that messed up your past in the first place. Perhaps that’s the point, that Spike couldn’t move on, but that’s not confronting the past and that's not saying anything more substantial either.

              The other half of the problem is that your immersion in Cowboy Bebop is highly dependent on whether or not you resonate with its nostalgic longing for the past. I don't. I always look towards the future. If you gave me the chance to go back to my childhood or high school, I wouldn't take it because I'm always trying to build on what came before, so that every day I'm a better person than I was before. Thus, when I see the crew of Cowboy Bebop with all the freedom in the world and long lives ahead of them, I don't understand their unwillingness to look at new possibilities. This wouldn't be a problem if the show did a better job of making me understand why exactly they have trouble letting go instead of talking about the past in general. Spike has trouble letting go of two things: 1) Julia 2) his time in a crime syndicate. It's easy for anyone to understand how hard it is to move on from a loved one, but still, the relationship between Julia and Spike is barely shown and when Julia does show up, she has a pretty boring personality. As for the gang activity, is it that Spike has trouble leaving behind his gangster ways? Does he miss the brotherhood of the gang? Does he need the adrenaline? It's never entirely clear, so it's harder for me to comprehend why this good-looking, talented 23 year old with no laws governing him doesn't go and enjoy his life. It's the same story with Faye's past. If I got a look into her touching relationships with her family and friends, it would be much easier for me to understand why she wants to go back to that so badly because I too, would be feeling her attachment. Whereas in her current situation, I see that Faye is lucky enough to find three other people that give her a place to stay, a job to work, and company, which is a damn good deal for a person who just woke up with nothing left. If the show did go down this more specific role, it would also allow a scene where Spike or Jet inadvertently do a specific gesture for Faye that her family once did, cementing the ragtag family dynamic in a much stronger way that also helps Faye cope with her past in a specific manner. Jet, as I mentioned, gets the best treatment in that I readily understand his pain from his girlfriend leaving him and he gets to throw away his broken watch. At the same time, just like with Spike, the discussion around his attachment to his police days is muddy. Jet is deadset in his methods, straightlaced, and carries the image of a dog who never lets go. This is the mentality that gets him shot and betrayed, which he finds out later. Ok, but now you're retired and free to do whatever you want? In what way are you being tied down by your past? Is it that your straightlaced attitude and stubborness still leads to problems in your life? Well you at least dealt with your commanding nature in Waltz for Zizi already. You find out your partner betrayed you. It's never shown what kind of impact this has on Jet's straightlaced dog persona. Having a past that defines and weighs on a character is basic character writing. The rest of the work has to deal with the specifics of each past instead of settling for a useless general statement of "the character can't move on from the past" or "the character decided to move on".
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The Bourne series does this past thing a whole lot better in terms of having a past that you can't escape, because it literally has the CIA constantly try to kill Bourne despite his attempts to start a new life. Mind you, Bourne has no memories just like Faye, and he's been a gun toting martial artist just like Spike. You see Bourne specifically struggle with resisting the programming the CIA gave him and struggle to decide whether or not to kill someone. The Nobel prize winning book Disgrace follows an aged professor who struggles to let go of the days of white privilege and sexual dominance. I'm no rapist, but the book does a good enough job making me at least understand why its main character is and also why he refuses to change. It's not just about not letting go of the past; it's specifically about how to deal with a fall from power and subsequent disgrace. The book doesn't simply say "move on", it follows the protagonist on a long, harrowing journey to starting a new chapter in his life. On JJ Redick's podcast recently, former NBA MVP Steve Nash talked about how hard it was to accept that his days in the NBA were over despite his desperate attempts to keep himself in the game. He then makes peace with it by acknowledging that he has had a good career, and that he can transfer his competitive spirit into other areas in life. For him, letting go of the past was letting go of the spirit of competition and the support from the fans. Satoshi Kon's short film Magnetic Rose deals with an opera singer stuck in the past of her glory days. We clearly understand that she misses performing and the fame that comes with it and that's why she can't let go. The answer to the question of the past is always "you have to make your peace with it and move on". That's kind of a non-statement. The duty of shows that choose to tackle the topic is to explore how exactly this is done on an individual level (and not simply have a character decide to move on abruptly like Ed). Or if people keep falling into a cycle, still explore attempts to move on rather than just drifting around and then pinpoint the factors that counter these attempts to move on. Because despite what the show suggests, the past is not always a weight. It is certainly not for me at this point. A show can take the opposite approach and talk about the past lovingly as fond memories, like Kaiba.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              All in all, why am I even bothering to write so much about this issue? If I hadn't known any better, I would've just said that Cowboy Bebop is a good to great action adventure with a lot of style and a sprinkling of brokenness and themes about the past to add some dimension the characters carrying out those fun action adventures. There's a simple message that's repeated for 26 episodes. The thing is, Samurai Champloo is pretty much a mirror image of Cowboy Bebop and you don't see people proclaiming the same things about Samurai Champloo as they do about Cowboy Bebop. Champloo literally has characters doing suicidal things to find out they're really alive TWICE in the same episode. At that point I decided that Watanabe really doesn't have anything more to say beyond "people can't let go of their past so they're stuck in a state of limbo" and my feelings about Cowboy Bebop weren't a fluke. And just like Cowboy Bebop, characters will go through events and things from their past and it doesn't change them at all. Sure, it fleshes them out, but you don't even get to hear their thoughts on it. Later in Samurai Champloo, another character must let go her past by letting of of her hope that her son is alive, but this one moment is more powerful to me than Spike's and Faye's stories.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              There's a case to be made that Bebop is really about simply showing how people repeat themselves and can't move on from their old habits, and that's fine but I don't know, maybe I'm just not old enough to connect emotionally with it.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It looks like I'm nitpicking Cowboy Bebop, but in an episodic series, you really have to nail every single minute, and as for its substance, it failed to arouse emotion or resonate with me. I think its massive hype also affected my opinion, as I might have rated it higher if I just went in not knowing anything. Is it a masterpiece? Yes, if you buy into its message about the past. I don’t, but perhaps that will change as I get older. Still, it’s not just a legendary anime--- it’s a legendary work of storytelling in general.

            I rated this anime by how I watched several anime in the past 2 years. In celebration I am writing this review to start my reviews.
            <br>
             WARNING: Some spoilers ahead.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             First of all this Cowboy Bebop is like several anime in the past like Pokemon and Voltes V which makes the debut of the new character or new plot elements to introduce in every episode.
             <br/>
             Cowoby Bebop does the same but makes something different out of it. You can call it Sessions.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             In this sessions the viewers will watch how several aspects of life, or futuristic aspects implemented in the show.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             In terms of story I enjoyed several nostalgia
             <span id="review219609" style="display: none;">
              effects of the books that you may have read or heard about the wild west. Both the art, sound, character resonates with the story as no single narrator is to explain what is happening or what is going to happen to our characters.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This makes Cowboy Bebop a classic with just PURE animation which nobody will not expect what will happen and makes you join the ride in which delves into the deeper themes of the show such as loneliness, future corruption of the environment, and space travelling.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              You JUST WATCH and SEE what happens in this show. That's the perfect way to enjoy it. You may need to go back and see it again if you need.
              <br/>

            Honestly anime is very hit and miss with me, either I love it to death or I hate it. This is an anime I love. I think it's a wonderful anime and, all in all I actually enjoyed all the episodes, which almost never happens with me and anime. I binge watched this in 2 days and now understand why this is largely regarded as a classic.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Story: 10/10
             <br/>
             <br/>
             While the story is of an episodic nature,  every bits helps develop the characters and the universe, and such it doesn't feel filler at all. It's a great mix between sci fi and space opera, and there's
             <span id="review228739" style="display: none;">
              effort done to give so credibility to the universe it's set in. Basically, it's set around a crew of bounty hunters in the years 2071, and their travels around the solar system looking for bounties. The setting is quite simple, but it's well executed, and every episodes adds a bit more to the characters stories, so that we learn every time a bit more of their past, and of their tragedies.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Which brings me to:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters: 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The story is great in it's own way, but if it works so well it's because it's carried by such a great set of characters. From Ed the tomboyish hacker to Ein the Welsh corgi, every characters add something to the show, making it so much more interesting to watch? They are all well thought out and developed more and more as the series continue, making us learn of their pasts by small bits. The voice acting is great too and brings a lot to the characters. I've only watched the sub, but i've heard the dubs were great so I think I'm going to watch that next, to compare the two.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound: 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The soundtrack of this show is just amazing. from the OP,  Tanks!, that's energetic af and sets the tone for whats to come, and the ending song, the Real Folks Blues, it really sets up a great atmosphere. The background music itself is amazing too, and helps move the story along. It's not a forgettable soundtrack, that's for sure, and every bit of it, from the harmonica tune to the sax solo  works very well with it all. The ending song  changes twice, only for one episode each, but it works really well and shows significant twist in the plot. Especially after the last episode. The ending song there is just perfect to stare at  your screen...
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art: 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              For a show made in 1998 the art and animation aged remarkably well. It doesn't look too dated and the colour scheme helps to set up this western-like vision of the future. The animation is smooth and fluid, and the fight scenes, in space or otherwise, are really a sight to behold. The characters designs are also memorable, and the background looks awesome. I found some of the skies particularly beautiful.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoyement: 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I think it's a trully enjoyable show. It can be comedic, serious, sometime even sentimental
              <br/>
              ( cause let's be real at the end you do care about what happens to the characters) but there's not one episode I didn't enjoy. They might be weird, funny or serious, I think they all have their appeal and such the show has a great binge watch capacity.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall: 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I honestly recommend this to everyone looking to start  a new show. It's just great, and for me at least truly deserves to be put among the masterpieces of anime. Of all the anime I saw so far I won't hesitate to say that this was by far the best yet.

            I'm not a big fan of episodic anime. I'm also not really a fan of the werstern genre.
            <br>
             <br/>
             The thing about Bebop is that it is in fact a classic. I can see that. In the same way I am not a big fan of classical music but can recognize the brilliance of Motzart, I can see that Bebop has its merits.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The story and the characters work very well together. It feels like an anime version of Firefly (which personally I'd also right at about a 7).
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The thing is that, it wasn't really thrilling to me. The lack of a real long term
             <span id="review221701" style="display: none;">
              plot didn't really invest me in the characters. The characters felt deep and well-developed, and each episode individually wasn't bad, but the thing about episodic anime to me is that they can't really reach a climax. Even though Bebop's end climax was solid, it is different than watching characters change and struggle on a journey to reach the approaching peak. Bebop was sort of everyday living in this new world, then story resolution at the end kind of.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I enjoyed it. It was solid storytelling, good characters. But I just can't get behind the universal praise Bebop receives. It's good, but no masterpiece.

            Cowboy Bebop - before you decide to watch this anime get ready to go on a serious feels trip. It may seem harmless, but it's a lot more than just a comedy - based anime. This genius work of art, coming from Shinichirō Watanabe (you may know him from directing Samurai Champloo, Zankyou no Terror or Sakamichi no Apollon, he produced all of those aswell), will take you to the realms like you've never experienced before.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Eventho the anime started airing throughout 1998, and finished in about April 1999, it had pretty decent animation I've to say. But I'd still rate it a 6, just because
             <span id="review210082" style="display: none;">
              most of the scenes are portrayed as moving pictures, and don't any actual animation in them. But I guess that's reasonable because it was 1998 and all that shit.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Neverthless, this anime posses one thing that I rarely see in the anime made throughtout this millenium - the actual goddamn story. The story itself isn't a fascinating one I'd say, but I've enjoyed watching the fillers that cover the background story of every single character itself. The reasons why they were scarred, the reasons why they did the stuff they did, and so on. I found it so much more amusing watching the anime that was made at the end of the previous millenium that these they make nowadays tho. The animation may be poor, but you can see the actual story somewhere.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So, without further a do, as you can read in the synopsis, the whole story revolves around Spike and Jet, two bounty hunters who chase intergalactic criminals and do badass stuff all the way down to it. The anime was quite well paced I'd say, not too fast, and not too slow I guess. And yeah, the ending was perfect I'd say, just to my liking. Of course I won't spoil the ending, just saying it tho.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Oh, and so my favourite part - the OST's of this anime are really, really amazing. That opening song was easily the best one I've ever heard. Every single time I watched the opening, which I really rarely do, I mostly skip them all. The music matches the scenes so well, you just can't hate it. I mean, who doesn't love a chilly OST or an opening song? Well, that's about it, the only real thing I can complain about here is the animation, so I rated it a 6, but the whole anime overall - I rate it a pure 10.

            Cowboy Bebop is the like the Firefly of anime.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Although an older animation it still is consistently counted as one of the best anime's of all time and rightly so. A great story with some amazing characters make this a highly enjoyable anime.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The story is fantastic with a combination of mystery and action, however the pacing is odd at times and it feels like you are just watching filler episodes which at times can make it boring, but the baseline story remains strong and finishes it off well.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The art although old fits well with the world that it is set in, everything looks dirty
             <span id="review197650" style="display: none;">
              and authentic. Old animation tends to turn people away form Bebop but after the first few episodes you grow into it.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The sound and voice recoding is not up to standard however with poor sound effects and sometimes awkward voice acting can make you cringe. The music of Bebop is fantastic, a brilliant opening theme really sets the mood for the upcoming episode.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The characters are the heart and soul of Bebop and make the show what it is. All the characters feel unique and have there own detailed back stories which give them depth. You really start to love them and by the end you don't want to say goodbye.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall this is a thoroughly enjoyable anime and I would recommend it to any fans of Joss Whedon's Firefly. A must see for any anime lover old or new.
              <br/>

            After all these years, I've finally watched Cowboy Bebop. And I have a great time.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop is a classic into the anime world of 26 episodes, Aired in 1996 by the studio Sunrise.
             <br/>
             He was aired in 1996. 1996. Yes it's the third time I write it, but it was an important detail, because I was so amazed by the animation !
             <br/>
             <br/>
             So the first point: the draws and the animation. It's one of these rare pearl in this field.
             <br/>
             It's dynamic, clean, and precise. And God knows we needed this to follow these bounty hunters !
             <br/>
             I though have already saw all about 90's japanimation, but this
             <span id="review224411" style="display: none;">
              anime surprised me, really a good job.
              <br/>
              There is CGI sometimes, but not a nuisance, pretty well-mastered.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The second striking point for me are the OST. Or do I call them, Insert Song? The large majority of the OST are  already know famous jazz song, it sets a unique atmosphere, very interesting.
              <br/>
              It's by the way the anime slogan "the work which becomes a new genre itself will be called Cowboy Bebop" and after finished watch the anime, I think they are true.
              <br/>
              Oh and the opening James Bond's style is awesome!
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters are endearing. Excepted Ed who, for me, is here for scenaristic readiness.
              <br/>
              They all have 2 or 3 episodes about their past and other, and it's largely enough.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              When I heard about this anime, I though that it was very serious, dark, and take itselfs too seriously. But hey, humour was here too! And is probably the most revelant side of this anime.
              <br/>
              3-4 Boundy Hunters so poor that they can't eat and have to hunt all the time.
              <br/>
              Plus, interactions between characters are hilarous!
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So, why only 9 ?
              <br/>
              The problem, for me, comes from the genre itselfes.
              <br/>
              The serie are composed of stand alone episodes. And I didn't really like that. It was cool the first part of the serie, but after, you're awaiting for a show which tell something ! And all elements was here: Endearing characters with tragic past, OST, atmosphere.
              <br/>
              But no, there is only a few episodes about their past dispersed through all the serie. I think it's too bad.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              But to conclude, this serie is fun, with an unique atmosphere, excellent OST, endearing characters and perfect 90's animation. A Masterpiece. Hurry on it !

            For my anime reviews I am going to review the anime on the order of which you would experience while watching an episode of the anime that is being reviewed.
            <br>
             <br/>
             1.Art - The first thing that spoke to me from this anime was how good the animation was.  Of coarse it wasn't the best animation but it must have required a huge amount of effort to animate it as well as it was animated.  The series' art was hand-drawn, that means that the animation was and just for that fact you have to respect the artists for this anime and the best part is
             <span id="review195341" style="display: none;">
              that the art continues to get better throughout the anime.  The art was spectacular but it isn't quite good enough to get a ten so it will get a 9.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              2.Sound - First I wanna start of by saying the intro is just plain awesome.  They didn't have to make a second intro and they knew well that the first one was to good to be out-shined.  The rest of the soundtrack never bothered me, oh wait YES IT DID.  If I ever hear another horribly composed saxophone solo I am going to shoot myself…. I’m not kidding!  Other than, that the jazz feel really set a smooth mood to the action scenes, I totally dug it.  I can’t give a 10 because of those horrid saxophone solos so i’ll give the sound an 8 but that’s still pretty good.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              3.Character - I don’t think that I will find another series with more lovable characters than Cowboy Bebop.  The characters were very unique and the were all lovable, even some of the people who weren’t main characters were lovable.  There is not much else to say about these characters, they were all unique, lovable, and well-developed and I wish that was how all animus were.  Undisputed 10/10 for characters.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              4.Story - The story….. well….. wow. It was a good story to say the least and
              <br/>
              there wasn’t one instance where I wasn’t enjoying it.  A lot of people thought the ending was amazing but I really failed to see how it was so cool.  It didn’t
              <br/>
              blow me away like it might have intended to but it was very satisfying as an ending and it did leave me with a good feeling.  The story was amazing but for a little disappointment with the ending i’ll give it a 9.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              5.Enjoyement - Well… I enjoyed this show a lot and I can with no doubt call it a classic but I have seen shows that are just as good or even better than this anime.  That being said, this anime made me feel like a bounty hunter and that is what matter the most.  I enjoyed this anime fully and it gets a 10 for enjoyment.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This anime is an overall 9.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              *I would recommend this anime to a person of any age.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Caution:
              <br/>
              !Keep in mind this anime has mild gore.

              It’s undeniable that anime as an entertainment medium has a fair number of series that are considered classics. Among these, Cowboy Bebop is a name you hear relatively often. First released in 1998, only its first half was aired initially due to its “adult themes” and today it invokes nostalgia in many viewers. Certainly, compared to other shows of its time it has aged fantastically due to strong characterisation, a tone that stands out from the masses even today and animation that screams “vintage” rather than
              <span id="review203222" style="display: none;">
               simply “old”. Now, after having watched Cowboy Bebop myself, I can see why it was so prominent back in its day while still feeling that it doesn’t have the spark needed to be considered truly ageless.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               What Cowboy Bebop does really well, in comparison, is its characterisation. They’re deeper than your average fare and consistent to boot, as well as being fun to watch. For all of that, however, they’re not particularly memorable and I put part of that down to the lack of overarching story and part down to the fact that they develop independently of each other rather than via interaction. In the episodes that are important for characterisation, the individual of the hour tends to go off and do their own thing with minimal contact with the rest of the crew. While it reflects their tenuous links to each other well and makes sense, it also renders it harder to make the group as a whole stand out.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Summary – When Cowboy Bebop first aired it would have made major waves, so I have no trouble understanding why viewers still look back on it fondly. The animation and characters have stood the test of time excellently and just about every other aspect of the show could stand up to newer counterparts without shame. Unfortunately, the series as a whole lacks the cohesion granted by overarching plotlines that is needed to really shine and make itself memorable in the current day, and its meagre attempts at cultivating that are more detrimental than enjoyable. Still, if you like more gritty and relatively serious anime then Cowboy Bebop is well worth a try. After all, it’s a classic for a reason.

            Cowboy Beboop (ha) is an episodic anime with a dog. That is not a bad thing but that is essentially what is. The story is set in the future where the earth was partially destroyed and most humans live in space. It follows Spike and Jet, two cowboys (space bounty hunters) and their adventures in space.
            <br>
             <br/>
             This is an easy set-up for an episodic show to use because much like space the possibilities of an episodic show are infinite. It adds a few more mainstay characters that we learn about and that are interesting (including a dog!). The crew of the Bebop (Jet and Spike's ship)
             <span id="review212669" style="display: none;">
              are nicely miss-matched group, even Spike and Jet, but it's this clash of personalities and characters make them all the more enjoyable as a group and as individuals.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In saying this the voice actors do a good portrail of their individual character (I watched the dub). They're many moments in the show that gave you the 'feels' as it were, so one couldn't really argue that the VA's weren't in it, at least as my memory of the show serves. Furthermore the score was well done and makes every scene better than they usually are and is one that'll definitely stick if your a jazz or slow jam person. In addition the OP is one I still enjoy to this day and really works well both as an OP and a stand alone song, the ED thought not as good makes each episode feel complete.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The art style looks worn, though that is only due to Bebop's age and either be a plus or a minus depending on the taste of the person. Everything in the world of cowboy bebop feels and looks real to a degree and the movements are descent. The stiller moments seem to shine for me more than the more action packed scenes but that's not to say they weren't good I just like the quieter moments in cowboy bebop more.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Lastly I'd like to say that I enjoyed Cowboy Bebop as both an idea and a show. I don't enjoy a lot of episodic shows because they get repetitive (Simpsons, Spongebob, Fairly Odd Parents) but Cowboy Bebop shuffles the focus every episode to offer a little something  for everyone. No episodes felt the same or dealt with the same character or plot, which is to be expected of an episodic show and as such a lot of the plot comes at the end.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In conclusion if your looking for old, fun, gritty, and episodic anime that feels different every episode then Cowboy bebop is the show your looking for.

            Cowboy Bebop is a show that I can best describe as an anime that dares to mix genres. On the surface it looks like your typical Space Western, but once you delve into the real meat of the show you will find everything from romance, action, comedy, philosophical themes and spirituality. The fact that the show manages to round so many corners in its 26 episodes, while still stringing together a coherent story, supplemented by an amazing cast of colourful characters, with heroes, villains and everything in between, makes it one of the most enjoyable anime I have seen in my entire life.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop is
             <span id="review112927" style="display: none;">
              an episodic anime. Each new episodes deal with a new story, with the exception of the character driven episodes scattered in between, that sometimes span over several episodes. The actual plotline is solid and engaging, leaving you hungering for more answers every time you learn a little more about one of the characters. It is the life that these characters have lead up until the point where the viewer meets them, that really help flesh them out and stop them from becoming one-dimensional stereotypes.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The artstyle in Cowboy Bebop is detailed, creative and fitting. Mostly dull metal and earth tones are mixed with neon colours and really help drive home the feeling of both the loneliness and grandeur that can be experienced in a galactic spanning civilization. One episode you might find yourself in the dusty streets of a Martian colony, the next in a colourful floating casino located in orbit around a planet.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The soundtrack is one of the many high points of Cowboy Bebop. Everything from tribalistic drumbeats to snazzy jazz tunes and even modern electronic music are to be found within the series and all of them help set the mood perfectly. In an anime that is as broad as Cowboy Bebop, a good musical score is immensely helpful in setting each episode apart from another and Yoko Kanno has done a fantastic job.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Now I will touch upon the characters of Cowboy Bebop, who in my opinion are what ultimately manages to carry this show into near perfection. The calm and collected Spike Spiegel, the grumpy and life-hardened Jet Black, the seductive and devious Faye Valentine, along with resident nutball "Ed" and her hyper-intelligent laboratory dog "Ein" make up the main cast of the show. Every single one of these characters have a story to tell and they are all interesting, action-packed and in some cases, heart-breaking.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              These characters come together as Bounty Hunters in an attempt to escape the ghosts of their past. Most importantly the show doesn't forget about this. These characters aren't your typical goodie two-shoed heroes. Ultimately they are in it for the money and while they do have a working moral compass, they aren't shy when it comes to getting their hands dirty.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall Cowboy Bebop provided some of the most entertaining episodes of a TV-series I have ever had the joy of experiencing. Some episodes more suspenseful and thrilling than others of course, but all of them can hold their own and is almost guaranteed to provide constant entertainment.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Unfortunately I cannot give this show a full score across the board. The show does deal with some clichés that at times are a little bit uniteresting, not to mention that with the episodic build-up, some of the less relevant episodes can end up feeling redundant at times. Still very much entertaining, but not really adding anything to the characters or the story and while they are very, very few, they are there.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              That being said, Cowboy Bebop is rock-solid from start to finish and raises the bar in terms of soundtrack and characters, earning it a fantastic 10/10.

            This Review is out of 100. 35/100 for Story, 35/100 for Characters, 15/100 for Sound, 15/100 for Animation.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Story - 31/35 - Where to start. The story is very good. Most episodes are separate from each other, so you can watch the series in mostly any order. It makes it easy to jump right into an episode without having to watch other ones. Each episode feels like it's a different genre from the last, with some being action packed, other being lighthearted and funny, while others a really serious. A lot of diversity here, which makes it an almost universal show. The central plot has
             <span id="review101107" style="display: none;">
              to do mostly with Spike and his past, although the other characters get their time in the limelight too. My only complaint is how the cast even after splitting up always seem to find each other in the end. They can travel the whole solar system, so it's a coincidence that happens a tad too often.  Lastly, this show has such an amazing ending that you can't help but love.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters - 34/35 - One of the best cast of characters you could ask for. They all just work so well together, and a very fun to watch. Spike in particular is very cool, and is probably the single coolest character in all of anime. The rest of the cast aren't slouches either, as they all have their good points. Even though we do learn a lot about their past and see them form a relationship with each other, I can't help but feel there is more to tell for each of them. The side characters are also very good, as is the main villain.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound - 15/15 - Arguably the best soundtrack in any show ever. I really love the score from this show, from its iconic opening, to all the jazz spread through the show, to the ending. Each episode has a specific genre associated to it, and it's cool to see the music change along with the episode. Also, it's probably the best example of English used properly in anime, and sounding VERY good and NOT like it's a separate language.
              <br/>
              As you probably know, the dub for this show is phenomenal, and should be watched over the sub. Even if you are a sub purist, watch this show dubbed.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Animation - 13/15 - The best of the best for its time. Sadly, its time was 1999, which was a while ago. It still looks beautiful and has very fluid movements, but it is still older.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall - 93/100 - Damn this was a good show. Easily one of the best I have ever seen, and one everybody should see. Don't miss this show.

             Cowboy Bebop is a totally original anime, is not an adaptation of a manga, light novel or anything before, was written and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe and the director of the brilliant soundtrack was Kobayashi Katsuyoshi.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Story (8/10): Cowboy Bebop tells the story of four bounty hunters trying to make a living catching wanted criminals and handing them to the police. Cowboy Bebop works in a way different from others animes, no arcs or anything like that, each episode is a different story with different
             <span id="review232752" style="display: none;">
              characters being added. Each episode they try to catch a wanted criminal or has a backstory of the main characters, there are some exceptions where the episodes follow in sequence with the 1st part and the 2nd part, the story is simple, however interesting, you see several different cases each episode and also the backstory of the main characters, but for me is the weakest point of the anime, because I prefer the division by arcs.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art / Animation (8/10): considering that this is an anime 1998, the animation is very good and fluid, the well-designed characters and each very different from the other, not only in the characters design, the clothes too, action scenes are impressive too, very well made, in melee combat and also when they use firearms, speaking of fire, also very well done and lively, vibrant and bold colors, the smoke is also amazing, the space ships and design are also very good, the animation is very good indeed, but also has its small technical problems like all animation, but does not hurt one bit the experience.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Soundtrack (10/10): undoubtedly the most positive point of Cowboy Bebop, the soundtrack is jazz, blues and other popular music of the 80's and 90's, blends perfectly with the anime, sometimes the soundtrack is a bit of the old west style for a change, which is also very well made, the action scenes and especially in drama scenes you are impressed with such art work. It is truly a masterpiece.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters (9/10): I liked all the main characters, they are
              <br/>
              interesting, each with its strong and aggressive personality, taking Ed, she is very cute, spike is undoubtedly the most interesting, he seems unconcerned, but is more troubled by his past of the group, he is very skilled in melee combat, besides being a great shooter and also a talent with ships, Faye Valentine is extremely greedy and "selfish" always does everything to get along, but Faye inside is a child who does not know his past or "the place that she should return", she is not good in melee combat, but is good with ships fihts, Faye never had a intense gun battle to I evaluate his ability, but the little I've seen, she's good. Ed is just Ed, she's a hacker child who lived in an "orphanage" before being recruited to the Bebop, Ed is the typical noisy children, and live always hungry, Jet is the oldest of the group, owner of Bebop, who has a history with the police, but due to some events decides to become a bounty hunter, Jet always tries to be show the tough guy, but he cares a lot about his partner Spike, who lives just chasing his past and Jet does not agree with this, prefer Spike go ahead, Jet never had a melee combat, much less in a shootout, the to count on one hand the times he took action without I doubt the 2nd character with less focus i the anime, behind Ed.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall (9/10):
              <br/>
              I strongly recommend Cowboy Bebop if you like an anime with lot of action, drama, and a perfect soundtrack, undoubtedly an anime epoch and one of the best I've ever seen.

            this show is a touchy subject I find with a lot of anime fans. Me myself, I had always heard of this show growing up and thought it was boring as balls. Or I was too busy watching DraginBallZ. But now that I've matured, and had the chance to buy this show and watch it to it's fullest potential, I gotta say, it was one great investment. let's jam!
            <br>
             <br/>
             Story:
             <br/>
             Well the story of Cowboy Bebop is pretty simple, a group of bounty hunters who want to do nothing more than make enough money to at least not starve to death in the galaxy. But the other
             <span id="review209092" style="display: none;">
              half of the story is how each character  has a past that will come back to haunt them. See the story to Bebop is both awesome and hard to get people to watch. As I had watched GRarkada's review on it before watching it, he said the first four episodes would be a snooze compared to what the other episodes had in store for you. so if you want my recommendation it will be the same as his because it worked for me. watch episodes 5, then 6, then go back and watch episodes 1-4 and watch 7 all the way to the end. Trust me, it works.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Animation:
              <br/>
              You gotta remember this show came out in 1998 and ended in 1999 people, you aren't getting any PA works animation here. But if you look at other anime from the time the show is pretty high standard for the time. The other good note for the animation, one being my personal thing that I like, is that the animation made the character's and their look feel bluesy. Another good note worth mentioning is that the action scenes are very smooth in execution, which is great cause that is one the best parts of the show is the action.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound:
              <br/>
              The sound in Cowboy Bebop is easily where this show shines the most, not even up for debate. This is the show that has one of THE best English dubs of all time, and if it's not the best, then it damn well was the first before this dub, dubs were SHIT! Steve blum as Spike Spiegel sealed the along with Bo billanger as Jet, and the voices of faye and ed were amazing as well (forgot the actress's names.) However as good as the dub is, the music in Bebop is just as perfect as well. the show has an amazing selection of music from jazz, to blues, being the genres the show has the focal point on, to even some metal tracks, nice acoustics, you name it, it's got it. Fun fact, the names of the episodes are musically inclined as well, such as bohemian rhapsody and heavy metal queen. absolutely amazing soundtrack.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters:
              <br/>
              All the characters in Bebop are very well flushed out, and all very entertaining in their own way. The main character Spike, is as badass and to the tee of the rule of cool as it comes, Faye, the chick that may not be no martial arts master, but can hold her own with her sassy attitude and sensual trickery, Jet, who is more the wiseman of the group and Ed, the hyperactive comic relief which the show needed to add some color to the Bebop crew's rather down tone sometimes. And it works perfectly because they each bounce off each other so well the chemistry is great.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              My personal enjoyment:
              <br/>
              In all honesty, as much as I praise the shit out of this show, it's not for everybody. The show is episodic so I can see why people looking for a deep plot wouldn't like it. But if your looking for something simple/epic and fun as hell characters, there is few better to watch than Bebop. overall, it's a classic, and should be viewed as such.

            Cowboy Bebop was a watershed for me . I was 16 years old when I first watched it and I remember how it was a great feeling to watch your episodes and it was sad to watch the last two .
            <br>
             It is very hard to find animes with such great quality nowadays, whether in history or even in art . I watch animes like Shingeki no Kyojin in and I think, " What kind of crap is this ? " . Besides the terrible stories , animations are bad and lazy.
             <br/>
             I had never seen an anime with so much adrenaline and with a dose of
             <span id="review122913" style="display: none;">
              perfectionism as big as this anime.
              <br/>
              Influenced by an amount of things, like jazz movement in the early 40's (?), to noir cinema, Nouvelle Vague, philosophy and even religious themes and samurai laws, Cowboy Bebop's animations flow naturally . You do not feel like everything is mechanized or robotic , even when scenes are repeated numerous times to save the work of animators, wich is hard to see in an anime with so much to say and so little time to show.
              <br/>
              And speaking of work, I had never seen a soundtrack as flawless as Cowboy Bebop. A jazz music with influences from rock, pop, classical music and even bossa nova or gypsy music.
              <br/>
              The story is about a group of bounty hunters , as you may already know and is told in "closed episodes", which is not very attractive . It was not, it is not and it never will be.
              <br/>
              However , the trump card of the story are it's characters. They are strong and I do not speak of their physical size, but their personalities. None of the characters in Cowboy Bebop are typical anime cliches (like Goku or Luff) , nor are predictable and lacking charisma ( like the characters in Shingeki no Kyojin ), they are striking, original and unpredictable. You never know if Spike will lift your opponent or take shoot him in the middle of his forehead .
              <br/>
              It is no exaggeration to say that Cowboy Bebop is one of the most influential anime of all time, next to Akira, the films of Hayao Miyazaki and, why not , Akira Toriyama ?
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop opened Western's eyes to action animes, aimed at an older audience, who were satisfied with comics like Sandman, Allan Moore's comics and among others, and influenced all sectors of our artistic side of the world, since cinema, to comics, music and even literature.
              <br/>
              You can find influences from Cowboy Bebop in mainstream films such as Tarantino and Matrix, to underground artists like Dawn of Midi and even King Krule .
              <br/>
              Sure Cowboy Bebop was also very influenced ( Lupin III and the movement of jazz are just some of the more obvious influences), but it was the mastery in uniting all these references (musical, artistic, visual, literary, phylosophical and religious) that make this anime the best anime of all times , in the humble opinion of this fan .
              <br/>
