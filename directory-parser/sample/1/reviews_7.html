            Cowboy Bebop is an absolute classic. Most people would say this is 'the pinnacle of all anime shows'. While there are some aspects of the show I liked, to say that this is the BEST of the BEST seems a little far-fetched to me.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop is set in the distant future where space travel has been developed. Bounty hunters exist around the solar system to capture criminals and survive by being rewarded for their bounty. The story centres around 4 main characters - Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Faye Valentine and Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV (or Ed) and it tells us of their journeys
             <span id="review105961" style="display: none;">
              and struggles.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I'll get a lot of the repeated praises out of the way first, before people completely disregard the whole review for the issues I had with the show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The animation is splendid - that, I simply cannot deny. For a 1998 anime, the quality definitely rivals the most up to date ones and still surpasses a vast majority of them. The movements of the characters and attention to detail in the backgrounds are so crisp clean, it is virtually eye candy for any viewer.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Another thing Cowboy Bebop succeeds in is the soundtrack. The opening song 'Tank!' is one of the most iconic tune in anime history and will be immediately recognised by most anime watchers. Although the opening song and background music aren't suited to my tastes (by that I mean I wouldn't listen to them on my MP3 player) it sets the mood perfectly for a lot of the scenes within the show. Another compliment goes to the ending theme song 'The real folk blues' which I frickin love (Now THAT is on my MP3 playlist).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As for the voice acting, both the English and Japanese voice actors/actresses have done a wonderful job bringing the characters to life. Their performances in their own respective languages has virtually no flaws. So if you ask me which language to watch it in, it would be - it doesn't matter, both are good, it really is up to you.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Now here's where I must be careful of what I say...
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So why couldn't I enjoy this as much as the 99% of people who declare that this is the definition of masterpiece? I guess the main reason would be the episodic nature of the show. Of course this is subjective from person to person. I personally would have liked to see the characters have an overall goal where a satisfying conclusion is met rather than individual episodes with their own plots.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              But that isn't where the real problem lies. A good show should have a great start which draws the viewer in, a strong central story where character development can take place and finally, it should have a memorable ending. Unfortunately, the first few episodes of Cowboy Bebop aren't that entertaining. It's average at best but nothing spectacular to draw the audience into the show, if anything pretty standard fair to introduce all the characters.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It picks up its pace and starts to get interesting when it reaches the episode 'Ballad of Fallen Angels' (episode 5). I don't want to spoil anything, but this is the first episode where the anime gets more serious. We learn a little about Spike's past and it starts to get more fascinating... BUT here's where I feel Cowboy Bebop fails at. The episode just ends. It side tracks to something else. The next episode is something completely different, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it feels that what I've just seen gets abandoned - tossed to the side. Any tension built up from the previous episode is just gone and this happens throughout the show and I get really irritated.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I want to know more, but it never gives me that satisfaction. It's like the series is about to show something interesting, but then completely forgets about it in .5 of a second. It would be okay if the episodes after the 'serious' ones were JUST AS fascinating. But this simply isn't the case. They are decent/fine at best and this contrast from watching something amazing to plain average constantly gives the feeling of disappointment. Now this doesn't make it a bad show. It just means the series is average to worth watching at best but nothing spectacular for it to be called a 'masterpiece'.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              One more thing to add to the individual plots for the other episodes. It is either hit or miss in terms of how entertaining it is. There were some which I would have liked a continuation of, however, in most cases it just ends. It isn't a coincidence that the only episodes I genuinely enjoyed were the ones where they reveal a little about why the characters are the way they are now - a prime example would be Faye Valentines past. And as for the other episodes, I feel "meh" towards them.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Finally, for the ending... it's very good... I don't want to talk about it as it contains spoilers. All I can say is, it's a very fitting way to end the show. (yay! another compliment!)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Maybe I'm being too harsh in this review... hmm... okay... so if the story isn't a masterpiece, surely the characters should be able to 'carry' the series - so entertaining that simple actions by them make the whole show a masterpiece. Unfortunately, they aren't the most jaw dropping fascinating characters I've seen. Now before you shoot me down with a bazooka: allow me to explain; the main characters are very interesting but I feel that the show does nothing with them. I understand that Spike is supposed to be cool but the story doesn't do much to show that. Yes he is good looking, yes he has a sense of justice, yes he fights like a boss but... that seems like a stereotype to me. I would have liked to know more about his past, what did he suffer to become the way he is? Why is he so attached to Julia? These kind of questions pop-up not just for Spike but for the other main characters too. One possible reason for this could be Cowboy Bebop only has 26 episodes, it's quite difficult to explain everything in such a short time span.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Though the biggest problem for me was the supporting characters. I simply didn't give a damn about them. I wasn't particularly attached to them nor were they particularly memorable. Naturally for an episodic show like this, there are guaranteed to be characters which will be more interesting than others. The problem is, I felt no attachment to approximately 95% of the characters.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Let me give an example of one of the supporting characters, Vicious. He is the most interesting support character (in my opinion) and is supposedly the villain of the show but I can't help but question things like "why is Vicious like this?", "why is he supposedly the villain?", "what are his motivations?" It feels as though he's just there for us to 'agree' that he is a bad guy when there's no real reason for it. This is what I mean by the contrast of the serious episodes to the non-serious ones. I'm about to learn something from Vicious but the next episode just completely abandons the idea with the metaphorical 'episodic reset button'.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              All in all though, the main characters aren't bad but they aren't ones where I would stare in awe at everything they say. The supporting characters are - well to put it bluntly, weak. By that I mean they simply aren't memorable and it's not something where you would look back and go "maaan that young child who shot Spike is so cool - he's one really likable character" I hope at least one or two people can catch the gist of what I'm trying to say.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Now, let me just say Cowboy Bebop is by no means a bad show. Far from it actually. It passes with flying colours in the presentation aspect but I simply couldn't buy into the episodic style of the story with characters that didn't really do anything. I just don't think it truly is the 'pinnacle of all anime shows'. However, it harbours a 'worth watching' in my rating system and should be viewed by anyone as it is STILL a classic.

            How can I possibly review "Cowboy Bebop"? The show has been reviewed, and re-reviewed, and talked about, and taken apart, been overrated, underrated, and just done to death that at this point my words would make about as much difference as if I were to drop a lit match onto the surface of the sun. But, maybe my words will read and maybe you the reader will be aided by them.
            <br>
             <br/>
             The word I can use to describe this Anime best is cool. From the characters, to the artwork, to the soundtrack, to the dialogue. It's a smooth, fun, futuristic ride through this 26-episode series.
             <span id="review222315" style="display: none;">
              Most episodes are stand alone with a few two part ones that deal with the big picture plot of the series. It has a massive tech-noir flavor, futuristic settings that are fogged by clouds of cigarette smoke and a jazz melody in the background. I hope the future is this cool.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The characters in this show are unforgettable and grow on you very quickly. Spike Spiegel, the mellow martial arts bounty hunter with a mysterious past. Jet Black, the grizzled ex-cop with a cybernetic arm who enjoys gardening. Faye Valentine, the grifting femme fatale who always ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Ed, the little girl with a boys name who is a total genius and total goof, and Ein the Dog. He does dog stuff.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Now, don't go into this show expecting to be blown away. The amount of praise this show gets makes it sound like it will change your life, lower your taxes, and improve your gas mileage. It's a great show. A masterpiece. But step back, take a deep breath, and watch one episode at a time when you can. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Don't binge. I find this is best way to enjoy the show. Sub vs. Dub is a surprising big win for the dub. Steve Blum, Wendee Lee, Beau Billingslea, and Melissa Fahn as Spike, Faye, Jet, and Ed play their parts to perfection and set the gold standard for every English dub before or since. If all English casts were as good as this, subtitles would not be necessary.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I hope this review has helped you out and I thank you for taking the time to read it. Please enjoy "Cowboy Bebop" as much as I did. It's a great show. And a must-see for any Anime fan. 10/10. Check it out. Cheers!

            At 2071, Earth is not the only habitable planet in the Solar System. With the advent of hyperspace technology comes new rules, eras, laws, law-breakers and law-enforcers. Aboard the shuttle Bebop, bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black struggle, bounty after bounty, with unruly shipmates, mutated-lobsters and vengeful old-timers from the past, all while keeping the Bebop afloat.
            <br>
             <br/>
             My reasons as to why Cowboy Bebop is a must see:
             <br/>
             1. Spike Spiegel
             <br/>
             2. The Real Folk Blues soundtrack, and;
             <br/>
             3. Session 5: the Ballad of the Fallen Angels
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop is a straight-forward anime. Spanning 26 episodes called sessions, Cowboy Bebop boasts of great character designs, fluid animation, splendid voice
             <span id="review15786" style="display: none;">
              acting and one hell of a soundtrack.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is synonymous with great music. Each session is entitled with reference to a musical concept or title, and each session is buoyed by the ever present tunes and strains of jazz and blues, composed by the great Yoko Kanno.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Animation-wise, the series has outstanding visuals all throughout its entire season. Movement and action are beautifully designed (most especially Spike's fight scenes using jeet kune do) and top-notch. Those who prefer the visuals over the everything else will not be disappointed.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Combine great visuals, with great music, plus great characters and great story, this is one anime every anime lover should watch (See how many greats I used in just one sentence??)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              My only qualm with the series, a qualm that's quite insignificant, really, is the way the characters' backstory are never really fully explored. Conclusions and closures are, by turns, done during the first and last half of the season. Though all sessions are still enjoyable and comedic, it would have been nice if sessions devoted to the main characters story arcs were explored.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Still, Cowboy Bebop is one-giant step above other animes, one that should not be missed. Grab/borrow/rip/steal a copy and you've got yourself one big bounty

            Number of Episodes: 26 (about 20 minutes an episode)
            <br>
             <br/>
             Plot: A+ *In the future, the Solar System has become accessible to humanity. In the vast openness of space and the emergence of technologies, a bounty hunter society is created resembling America's days in the Wild West. The show follows bounty hunters Jet Black and Spike Spiegel as they go on adventures flying their ship the Bebop across the galaxy trying to collect bounties for woolongs. On their journey, they pick up three new crewmembers named Faye Wong, Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivruski IV (Or just Ed) and Ein. They go on a few wacky adventures, and
             <span id="review334673" style="display: none;">
              have some heavy backstory episodes. It's an exciting world with interesting people and a lot of messed up scenarios too.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Visuals: B: It's funny, at first glance, I was bothered with Spike's hair to head size ratio. Now I think has one of the most badass designs for a protagonist ever. It doesn't hurt that his fight scenes are animated very well and he is such a badass. Despite there being prettier looking anime out there, there is a certain charm to this hand-drawn world. My only gripe would be that a lot of the backgrounds tend to be really dark. It reminds me of older episodes of the Simpsons. I feel like it could use more vibrant colors. The dark blues everywhere isn't always the nicest to look at.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Voice Acting: A+ *I can't believe that I once gave this anything less than an A+. So in my defense, Bebop was the 2nd anime that I watched and having a character like Ed in it was startling for me to say the least. But on the rewatch, I didn't mind her voice as much. In fact, I actually enjoyed her antics. But Spike, Jet, and Faye are absolutely perfectly cast. There's a reason that Bebop is considered by many to be one of the best dubs out there.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Film Score/Soundtrack: A+ * All, 4, of the released OST are amazing! My brother ended up asking me if I was stranded on a desert island, what would be the three albums that I  take with me? I cheated a bit, but without hesitation, I said the Bebop OST inferring that I wanted every song from here. He allowed it not realizing that there are 4 disks worth of content on here. But if I really had to choose just 1 of them, I suppose it would have to be Blue which is composed of all the soundtrack songs on the show's OST. It's not that I don't love the show's score, (because I am absolutely obsessed with it and jam with Edward all the time to it) it's just that the Blue album carries a lot of (weight) emotions for me which puts me in a good melancholic mood.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ***Favorite Track: Space Lion***
              <br/>
              (The fact that I'm able to single out a single song is impressive. Because there are so many great ones. But Space Lion elicits so many strong emotions due to the episode it is played on and because the sax is so Blade Runneresche! "Oh Ed... anything but blue.")
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters: A+ *Another category I find funny that I gave anything less than an A+ upon my first viewing. The very strength of Bebop besides the music is the characters. Spike Spiegal might be the most iconic character in the show and in all of anime, but more often than not, he isn't even the main focus of an episode. Jet, Faye, Ed, and even other side characters share the spotlight as their backstories are explored and the world is explored.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cringeworthy Anime Moments: Well you don't have to worry about unexpected fanservice popping out of nowhere too often in this show because Faye Valentine's "tatas" are on display in just about every frame that she's present in. If she didn't have such a well-written backstory and wasn't so entertaining at being a trainwreck, I'd call her walking fanservice but that does an injustice to a great character. The main anime moments on this show that I can think of are the over-the-top eating animations, characters getting angry really quick over dumb arguments, and a few unnecessary boob jiggles from Faye. But other than that, this show is an absolute delight!
              <br/>

              Titles:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Opening Titles: A+ *"I think it's time we blow this scene. Get everybody and their stuff together. Ok, 3,2,1 let's jam!" Talk about a killer first impression. Awesome exciting jazz track with great visuals that got me super excited for the show. One of the best openings to a TV show I've ever seen. Also, love the closer The Real Folk Blues too.

              Closing: A+ *The rare anime where you don't skip the intro or the closing track and you sit through every second of it with each episode.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Final Verdict: 9/10 *To a casual observer, Cowboy Bebop is an anime about a plucky group of bounty hunters in space that go on wacky adventures while jazz music plays in the background. And there are a bunch of episodes where that description fits the bill. But Bebop is a much heavier show than meets the eye. Once it starts getting into the backstories of characters which helps to explain their lifestyles and how they came to be the people that they are, that's where we start to really connect with them and see that this fun world that this fun futuristic world that Shinichirō Watanabe and company created is actually more of a dystopia than it is a utopia. That's not to say that there isn't a lot of good in the world of Bebop. But even in a world of space ships, awesome computer technology, and exciting adventures, real human problems (although much more unique than the ones we would face) exist. But of course, in Spike's case, his past is much more complicated and dangerous than any normal person. Lucky for Spike, he is well-equipped to handle it. But how about Faye and her past? How about Jet when he confronts his? How about Ed? What a show!

              Favorite Episodes:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Best: Jupiter Jazz Parts 1 and 2 *Incredible set-up for an emotional gut-punch at the end. Having Space Lion play at such a pivotal moment certainly doesn't hurt either. Gren is one of those side characters you just don't forget. It was during these episodes when I realized how much I loved Bebop.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Best Concept: Brain Scratch *A philosophical episode that pokes fun at cults and questions the nature of religion but in a fascinating way by discussing the idea of having the human mind put into a digital world so you can experience immortality and never have to feel your real physical body die. This episode is a much less subtle take on one of the more prevalent themes in the show about whether or not characters are dreaming or if they're living their life in the real world.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Most Emotional: Speak Like a Child *A mysterious tape arrives for Faye and they try to find out what it's purpose is, and when they finally get to play it, it's the closest to a family the crew of the Bebop ever gets. I was damn near moved to tears.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Funniest Episode: Cowboy Funk *I have seen this episode more times than any other and I still am laughing the entire time. Cowboy Andy is the funniest side character in the entire show as a stereotype of American westerns and toxic masculinity, this episode is one you don't take seriously for a single second and you just laugh and enjoy the ride. See you Space Samurai.

            I finished Bebop and didn't dislike it. How I would describe Bebop is that the world they have made is one of the most 'lived-in' of all anime that I have watched. You may recognise it's age with it being a late 90's series but the detail, environments, animation are all superb. With the animation, it just goes above the standard you would normally expect. Spike's combat, Ed's unorthodox and springy movements are full of character, really charming stuff. Voice acting is generally great too.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Anyway, I would rather state why I find the anime as a whole to be underwhelming. Yes I went in with
             <span id="review308616" style="display: none;">
              higher expectations than normal as it is such a renowned series. Everyone has a story, which is great. These stories are described well to the viewer. This establishes the characters well. However, this is it. I know the characters and I like watching them do their thing but on the other hand, the show only gives so much for me to care about the characters to an extent. I don't prefer Bebop because it is generally ambiguous and favors episodic adventures that don't make me invested as much as an over-arching story would be. I know it isn't really fair as a review but still.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Spike versus Vicious doesn't feel fulfilling. I know why they are going at each other but all of their encounters don't feel powerful or tense. A lot of their encounters are mostly to showcase the brilliant animation and direction, but the impact of these showdowns really doesn't feel profound.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It is great to discover who the cast are and spectate their mischief, all with beautiful art and animation but without proper motivation that could invest my interest further, it is only a seven out of ten.

             I hate episodic animes. I hate them so much to a point where I break my keyboard whenever I'm watching one. Cowboy Bebop is no exception. I hated it. I hated it so much to a point that I loved it. I don't know if that makes sense but that's how I feel about this masterpiece.

             <br/>
             <br/>
             The concept is rather cliche. Future technology in combination with the Big Wild West and Jazzy feel.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             This doesn't mean it is not good. History
             <span id="review180351" style="display: none;">
              shows how copying good stuff is always good. And the idea of "Space Cowboy" is simply cool and awesome.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              By definition, filler episodes are episodes that are just there without any connection to the purpose of the anime. What makes cowboy bebop amazing is that its fillers have purposes.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As a person who greatly criticizes on Black Butler and Darker than Black's episodic storyline, I cannot do the same to Cowboy.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Unlike Black Butler, every little episodes in Cowboy is extremely interesting, which means, NOT boring. In Cowboy most if not all episodes stand strong on their own, so the connections they have with the main plot are clear and meaningful.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Unlike Darker than Black, the main characters of the show stays as the main characters. So all arcs have Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed as the center of the plot.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              All the characters have their own episodes. These episodes are scatters all over the place so we the viewers can change the flavor once in a while.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              My main problem with the show is that, I don't have the motivation to go to the next episodes... I guess that's just me.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The ending is awesome.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              All in all, this is how you do episodic show. I respect it despite the fact I don't like episodic show. They deserve the credit of making all the episodes interesting.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              CHARACTERS (Design 5/5, Development 5/5)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As I said previously, all the characters have their own background and development.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The Bebop Crew consists of Spike the Cowboy, Faye the hotty, Jet the daddy, Ed the kid and Ein the dog.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Spike is probably the most interesting cowboy in all of existence. For a lack of better term, he is a serious person, yet a troll. He is super positive, he is a likable person who is supposed to be the "Bang" on the ship. He died once, which adds layers and layers of mystery on top of this badass cowboy. As the show unfolds, his past is resolved...
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Faye and Jet are also very interesting. Like spike, they find Bebop their new home and abandoned their past. Unlike Spike, they are truly able to abandon their history and reborn. Spike is different from the rest of the crew because he cannot run away, or he choose to not run away.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Ed doesn't really have any personally background. She is a fun little character that infuses herself with the Bebop. She has her place in the show and I think the way they present it is great.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Ein is the best dog in the history of humanity. Period.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              GRAPHIC (Art 5/5 Animation 5/5)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The art is godlike. They are so gorgeous. The space scenes and the different planets are mind blowing. Characters are also very well designed.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Let's just put it this way so people would not run away because "old animations suck".
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop has 1998 animation that is better than the majority of the 2018 animations. The pictures are literally drawn BY HAND, FRAME BY FRAME. I could not believe my eyes when I stepped in to the episode. They are simply so smooth and detailed. The only time when you would see something that's recycled is when the spaceships take off. Action scenes are awesome.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The only thing I can say that is not appealing is that I watched a 4:3 series on a 16/9 screen. :/
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              SOUND (OP/ED 3/3, OST 3/3 Audio 4/4)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Not gonna explain the OP and the ED, go listen yourself. They are on youtube. (they are fantastic)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              OST. So much emotions. So much feels. I would say one can only hate it if he/she hates jazz. Who hates jazz?
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The dub. This is one of the first GOOD dubs made by the Americans. I think even the dub haters should at least respect the work. That said, the Original audio has great feels and tones as well.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              However, the stage of the show is in this multi cultural space. All sorts of people from different nationalities tag alone. I don't know about the Japanese version but the English does have great accent and it just feels right that a cowboy speaks English, isn't it?
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ENJOYMENT (9/10)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I loved the series. It is definitely in my top 3 if not top 1. But there were times during the show that I felt bored :/
              <br/>
              The beginning was not that good either. Well comparing to the rest of the series at least.
              <br/>
              And yea, I still don't like episodic anime.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I never cried for any show. But if I need to cry for a show, it's gotta be the ending of Bebop or Steins;Gate. (no i haven't watched clannad and Brotherhood yet)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              OVERALL (10/10)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              See You Space Cowboy.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Peace.

            You know how people talk about that movie that is just a "classic," the kind of movie you just /have/ to see at least once in your life? The one that was the /first/ of its kind, the one that started it all?
            <br>
             <br/>
             For me, that movie was the Godfather. Bare with me here, obviously Bebop is not a mob story (though there are some underground organizations). But like the Godfather it has a very large fanbase of people who praise the movie like it was shit from the anus of Jesus Christ himself and will slit your throat if you so dare to criticize it.
             <span id="review176775" style="display: none;">
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I did not love the Godfather. I didn't understand what was so special about it... it was just like every other mob movie I've ever seen. It was basically a shorter version of the Sopranos with a more satisfying ending. My family of diehard italians wanted to murder me in my sleep after I admitted my apparent lack of taste, but I couldn't help it.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Now unless you live a very blessed life, you've probably watched one of those classic movies and came away with the same feeling. Maybe it was all of the hype, or maybe it was just because you've seen it done so many times before and can't appreciate the originality. Either way, you watched it and you weren't that impressed.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Bebop is like the anime version of those classics.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Personally, I loved Bebop. Which is why I said "to hell with it" and gave it a 10 like so many others. That being said, I can definitely see how people may have issues with the show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It isn't amazing for everyone, and if you're going to watch it I highly suggest you attempt to disregard all of the hype. The show is a masterpiece for reasons that don't resonate with everyone, and going in with a certain mindset might skew your opinion
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Bebop is basically about a bunch of oddballs living together on a spaceship and occasionally catching bounties (do they ever actually catch one? I can't remember). To put it simply, the show is very episodic. Most people may call it "all filler," but that's sort of the point.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It isn't one straight narrative with a linear plot. It's not "going" anywhere. It's about the everyday life of the characters, and everyday life is pretty random. Especially if you're floating through space on a spaceship with no real aspirations or goals.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The characters are taking every day one step at a time, and the plot reflects that. And as you learn more about the characters, you come to understand why they have this attitude
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Through the episodes, the characters are more fanned out. This is where the writing really shines. There are moments in this show that are, in my opinion, fucking amazing. (see episode 5 "Ballad of Falling Angels" church scene) Moments that make you shout "holy shit", and moments that may hit you like a bullet through the heart. The characters are realistic and three dimensional despite the fact you don't really know /that/ much about them, and it's through those (admittedly scarce) moments.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The rest of the time you just have ministories about different bounties. They're amusing stories (most of the time) and I honestly enjoyed them. But I can definitely understand how this set up isn't for everyone.
              <br/>
              really
              <br/>
              Basically, don't go in with certain expectations. The show isn't for everyone. It is episodic, and what you may consider the "plot" only comes up in brief moments. These moments are great, but if you're not the kind of person who enjoys the in between, then you're not going to enjoy the show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              And there's nothing wrong with not enjoying the show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Just like there's nothing wrong with me hating the Godfather.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Or so I tell my Nonna.
              <br/>

            Even back in my high school years, when I used to catch a random episode of Cowboy Bebop on Adult Swim, and I would be thoroughly entertained.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Now, as an adult, I have come to appreciate this anime even more. Cowboy Bebop is not an anime that follows today's "Let's make everyone pretty, and kill a dramatic scene by throwing an iron pan at someone's head". Cowboy Bebop, to me, is the essence of what a great anime is.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Even though the show's main storyline is only truly there through a small handful of episodes, each episode leaves the viewer thoroughly entertained. Each character gets their moment
             <span id="review240008" style="display: none;">
              in the sun, so to speak, with some intriguing info on their backstory (usually in the form of an episode) that left me completely glued to the screen.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Awesome soundtrack (I still have it on my playlist to this day) , paired with great characters and well written episode to episode stories, leave the viewer wishing more anime out there did the same thing.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I found it shocking that this anime was not listed in the top 3. Cowboy Bebop still has great rewatch value for me (maybe every couples years or so, but it's there) . Drama, Comedy, Action, all perfected.  I feel this anime definitely deserves to be listed in the greatest anime of all time.

            Cowboy bebop is, in my opinion the best show to ever air on television. It is one of 2 shows I think are perfect.
            <br>
             Story:10/10
             <br/>
             The story is unique and very creative. Most of it is told by flashbacks and you learn more about the past of the show as it goes along. It does it perfectly.
             <br/>
             Art:10/10
             <br/>
             The art is amazing. Most old anime have an art style I don't really care for,(trigun for example.) but this is just awsome. The spaceships look unique, the character designs are wonderful, the way the drew everything is just awsome.
             <br/>
             Sound:10/10
             <br/>
             Nothing needs to be said here. Even if you haven't
             <span id="review189179" style="display: none;">
              seen this you have heard of the phenomenal soundtrack.
              <br/>
              Character:10/10
              <br/>
              The characters could not have been more perfect. Thayer are all likable, and the development on them is very impressive. As the show goes along, you learn more about their back stories that will make you appreciate them much more.
              <br/>

            Unlike some anime shows, this one does not grip you at the start, and some of the best/most interesting characters do not come in until a lot later.  The animation is slightly dated, and there are few special effects such as we are used to now.  The "futuristic" world shown is perhaps more reliant on spaceships, space travel, and successful colonization of neighbouring planets than is realistic.  However, despite these flaws, Cowboy Bebop remains an overall entertaining, engaging and, somewhat surprisingly, a moving show.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Great things about this show - the characters - they do have personality, annoyingly we never see the full
             <span id="review131527" style="display: none;">
              depth of some of the characters, even by the end of the show there are still some mysteries that are never solved.  The people in the show give a good idea of the feeling and setting of the show, a series of run-down, rather sorry worlds after the almost ultimate demise of the first.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The animation, as I said earlier, lacks special effects, particularly in the space-scenes, that we are accustomed to seeing in the 21st century, however the actual character designs are somewhat wacky and goofy at first - but ultimately, wonderful.  The unrealistically long legs and odd, long movements of the people in the show characterize its style, and somehow help to define the people in the show.  In particular the unrealistically wobbly arms of Ed (a character who arrives a little bit later) give us a good idea of his/her carefree, wacky, young, "wobbly" personality.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Some of the episodes, especially considering those nearer the end, feel a great deal like filler episodes, but almost every one is worth watching for the build-up to the last few, plus the film which came after this series and happens at some point "between" two of the episodes.  Most of the episodes in the beginning and middle give us little snippets of the characters' backgrounds and the plot which comes into play later on (most of the episodes are basically separate storylines).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The music is also a highlight of the show, most of being composed by Yoko Kanno, famous for her diverse anime soundtracks.  Well, the variety and depth of music in Cowboy Bebop should not disappoint.  Some of it is country/folk music, fitting the Western theme of the series (COWBOY), but that which is not, is less expected and is fitting to whatever mood the show is trying to portray.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I thoroughly recommend Cowboy Bebop, even if, on the surface, it does not appear to be your sort of anime show.  The kind of anime I generally watch does not fall into many, if any, of Cowboy Bebop's categories (e.g Ao No Exorcist, Blood Lad, Persona 4: The Animation), but I have absolutely no regrets whatsoever after watching a show of this nature.  Trust me, even if it is not your sort of thing, you'll have to admit, even if after watching only one episode, that Cowboy Bebop has its merits.

            Story 6/10
            <br>
             <br/>
             I mean it is not a bad story but is it really that "great"? A bunch of bounty hunters and a kid link up to go on adventures together while exploring a rather bland world set in space. The stories (episodes) could have been more exciting, with more plot twists, big reveals and emotionally driven. Frankly it was too straight forward for me to consider it anything amazing.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Art 8/10
             <br/>
             <br/>
             For a 90s anime it has aged very well. The spaceships are very unique and the environment represent space travel dystopian suited to its time.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Sound 9/10
             <br/>
             <br/>
             At first I was like "this OP is garbage and ED
             <span id="review220119" style="display: none;">
              is okay". Then as it went on, I discovered the soundtrack within the episodes to be the best part of the series for me personally. The songs are varied, the instrumentals are atmospheric and certain tracks fitted with the scenarios perfectly. Although I warn you, I only started to appreciate it later in the series.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Character 6/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I think I would have touched a nerve with scoring the characters this low but  they are mediocre. They are not particularly interesting when you compare them to something like One Piece where every character whether side or main are filled with so much personality. Spike is cool, Ed fluffy, Faye feisty and Jet a boring old man but these are pretty one dimensional (with interesting backstories I guess). But nothing about them gripped me, maybe they were too "ordinary".
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoyment 7/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Now I'll go into detail of what I enjoyed and didn't.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As mentioned briefly, the adventures are not that exciting besides Spike episodes. Luckily he got the most screen time.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Then we hit episode 12 and everything became a little more interesting with Faye's back story just starting then my interest tailed off again. By episode 20 I was a bit discouraged to finish it. Due to its episodic nature you are literally judging episode by episode. One minute it's interesting next minute it's average. It depended on the character in focus a lot of the time. Spike and Faye would captivate me briefly then Jet and Ed would bore me (bar the mushroom episode with Ed was fun).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Although, it ended very strongly - Episode 24 left me with a weird feeling. Seeing that certain characters were potentially leaving made me feel sad. I can't remember when my attachment to them creeped up on me but it just did. The sound track had placed it's role perfectly.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So the last few episodes were great. Suddenly everyone opened up about their true feelings and suddenly the characters came to life. But it was too little too late, it was not worth all 26 episodes. I would have rather just watched Spike/Faye related episodes or a movie that summarised it all.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The Anime does very little wrong. It doesn't engage in fan service or annoying anime tropes. Everything feels authentic and true to itself. If you enjoy the characters interactions you will enjoy the episodic nature and that's the problem. It's episodic so there's no bigger story or world building to keep your imagination turning. There's nothing to get your heart racing, no complex theories to chew over, no back stories to pull your heart strings (wait Faye's nearly had me but they didn't go deep enough!).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It's just every day life in space, well written with just the right amount of action. But I personally don't watch anime for this laid back sort of shows.Thus the wow factor didn't rub off on me. It didn't excite me enough. If I wasn't marathoning it, I doubt I won't anticipate an episode. I'll simply tune in if I had a spare moment.

            Cowboy Bebop: Spoiler free review
            <br>
             <br/>
             A truly surreal expirence to be had, Cowboy Bebop blends copious and subtle amounts of almost every genre.
             <br/>
             A picturesque expirence teeming with euphoria and a wonderful sense of adventure. The world is uniquley crafted
             <br/>
             and truly feels like its own.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Story 7/10 Cowboy bebop has an interesting concept of potraying it's story.
             <br/>
             Being an episodic adventure, sure each episode has a different plot, but intertwined is segments from the character's pasts, taking us into the present to be projected into the future.
             <br/>
             There is very little and a lot going on all at once spanned over this 26 episodic escapade!
             <br/>
             Simply put; we start in the
             <span id="review129609" style="display: none;">
              present, slowly unveil the past, and follow the characters into their future.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters 7.5/10 Cowboy Bebop is more character interaction than character
              <br/>
              development, and the interactions are well composed. The main characters have a lot of major differences,
              <br/>
              but that is not to say they fit well together. They bring out the best and worst of
              <br/>
              one another, which makes for some pleasantly awesome scenarios. Although progression isn't a main
              <br/>
              focus, it is sometimes brought to the foreground through; learning who a character once was or what they were like
              <br/>
              and who they are now, or are becoming. Cowboy Bebop has a unique way of unfolding their awesome cast of characters.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art Direction 8/10 Most modern day animes by comparison still don't do what Cowboy Bebop did in 1998!
              <br/>
              Action scenes are crisp and fluid, colors are done in a nice gritty finnese for the most part. Artsy
              <br/>
              moments ranging from vibrant with color, to the serene and subtle and moments with artistic pizazz!.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Music 10/10 If you're familiar with Yoko Kanno(the composer) you have already come to know her exceptional
              <br/>
              quality. This soundtrack is truly outstanding. Contemporary jazz, up-beat techno, surreal musical compositions
              <br/>
              truly every genre can be found here. For 26 episodes there is a WIDE array
              <br/>
              of tracks to be heard, and even American tracks from some well-known artists! The music brings the art direction
              <br/>
              and whole feel of cowboy bebop alive, overflowing with a truly genuine effort to combine with the anime and bring
              <br/>
              it to its peak. Every song fits every moment it is cast into, without being forced.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop will capture the attention of almost any anime fan, whether they are looking for action, adventure, sci-fi, even some casual
              <br/>
              slice of life elements. Each episode is written by a different individual, but there is an overall sense of
              <br/>
              direction. Overall I give Cowboy Bebop a 8/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Disclaimer: Some episodes can have a dramatically different feel, and I found some episodes to be personally slow.
              <br/>
              Do not let this deter you from missing out on an overall great anime!
              <br/>
              <br/>
              PS: If you found it helpful, or not helpful please, I implore you to contact me via message or comment!
              <br/>
              I'm really looking for critique and want to hear from the anime fans themselves! Thankyou, so much ^_^

            Hey there space cowboy/girl!!
            <br>
             <br/>
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Today I’ll be reviewing Cowboy Bebop. It wasn’t that long ago that I was sceptical with the quality an anime from the 90’s could produce. Of course my doubts were put to bed with the likes of Neon Genesis Evangelion.

             So the story revolves around Spike a bounty hunter who travels around on a spaceship called ‘Bebop’ with his partner Jet who owns the ship. Together the two go around looking for bounty heads to cash in on, though more often then not failing to succeed. Along the way we have the addition of Faye and Radical Edward who join in

              Don’t let the brief above fool you into thinking this is a happy-go-lucky bounty hunt full of comical failures. Oh no, you are in for a much better surprise than that. Cowboy Bebop has a good thing going, it has its priorities set straight from the get go and builds on it for the continuation of the series. The main characters get a great deal of screen time and have entire episodes dedicated for their back stories which few shows do now-a-days.

              Let’s turn our attention to the characters. Now I’m not going to go out of my way to hail the cast of Cowboy bebop ‘’AMAZING’ but the characters are very enjoyable. Spike is a old fashioned bad-ass, he always seem to get the job done in the end, but not with ease as the show portrays his flaws and the effort he has to put in so that things go his way. Spike is simply that cool guy you wanted to be in high school and not because he was a douche bag who bullied guys and skipped class to smoke, but because he is an all-round honourable and respectable man. Next is Jet he is that authority figure he is short tempered and very grumpy, but inside he’s just a softie. He is a likeable character and usually does the right thing. His story arc wasn’t that favourable to the other characters, but I still liked Jet as a whole. Next up is Faye. She takes the role of a femme-fatale. She is bitchy, hot-headed and a compulsive gambler. On top of that her memories were forgotten while she was in cryogenic freezing. Giving her story arc the annoying “I NEED TO KNOW WHO I AM. Kind of story arc which is annoying. Faye does however have her moments and I liked her. Finally we have Ed. She came along later in the series as the geeky, hyperactive computer hacker who doesn’t know any better. Ed is that bit of comic relief on the side. She lightens the tone and occasionally will give you a chuckle because she is just adorable.

              <br/>
              The art in the series is great for its time, in comparison to today’s standards it is appalling but again it came out in the late 90’s so you can’t really fault the show. The sound is very jazzy, well that’s what I gathered from the opening and it continues throughout the show as it fits in with the western tone of the series.

              Enjoyment, this plays a great part in this show as whether you enjoy the cowboy themes will be a contributing factor on whether the series does it for you or not. I found this to be very enjoyable the action scenes were fluent and exciting. The sci-fi elements also make it a good watch for fans of that genre, it does appeal to a relatively large audience. Those who don’t enjoy the series probably prefer the romance or magical girl/fantasy genre. Most people will find something to enjoy about the series

              Overall Cowboy Bebop was a fun ride I thoroughly enjoyed the series and although not every episode was spectacular there are things to give merit for. I’d also like to point out the ridiculously spontaneous episode 11. For those old fashioned, wannabe cowboys this is a must watch. Overall the series was an 8/10 and gets a definite recommendation from me.

            Warning :Minor Spoilers ahead
            <br>
             Ok, it's been a while since i saw this anime in top 30 anime list. Looking at the year it was aired I wasn't really interested to watch it. But after some friends recommend it to me and after I read sooo many reviews that give ten to Cowboy Bebop, I decided to watch it. At that time I was tired of animes that show too much moe, ecchi, and other stuff and I'll try the claasic ones. And.. It was..
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Story : (7/10)
             <br/>
             Ok, it has very interesting setting, a futuristic world where people have started living in other planets. Our MCs here,
             <span id="review144085" style="display: none;">
              are bounty hunters who have their own unique past. Interesting setting right? Unfortunately, the execution of the story can't deliver it to the audience very well. Cowboy Bebop is  too episodic which almost each episode has each own story. And from this episodic episodes, huge conflicts are only in 5 episodes or something ( if I remember it correctly). I wouldn't mind if other episodes are exciting, but most of it are flat and seems useless. You can even throw some episodes away and it doesn't affect the main story. Watching Cowboy Bebop makes me tired of waiting about Spike's past and what will happen to him and Vicious. I have to watch some uninteresting and some useless episodes before i got to see it. It makes me bored. well, but Spike's story was amazing so I think it's worth waiting.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art : (8/10)
              <br/>
              Art is very good. I like the character designs. Animation was amazing and makes me wonder if it really was made in 90's.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound : (8/10)
              <br/>
              Nice OST
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoyment : (7/10)
              <br/>
              Like I said before, it is hard to enjoy Bebop because some episodes seem useless and feel like filler. Some episodes are just plain and don't excite me. I can really enjoy only a few episodes.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall : (7/10)
              <br/>
              Overall, 7. It was interesting, but it wasn't exciting. Main concept is very good, but too many plain episodes. Maybe because it's classic, some rate it very high (mostly 10). But I don't want too rate it according to the time it was made. I won't divide anime between classic or not. I was also confused to rate it whether 7 or 8. I chose 7 finally. I think it deserves 8. But to me, 8.83 seems little overrated. But well, for those retro anime fans, I'm sorry. People have different opinion sometimes, right?

            "I think it's time we blow this scene, get everybody and the stuff together... okay, three, two, one, let's jam!"
            <br>
             <br/>
             Out of all the animes I have ever watched in my life, none has ever touched or graced the perfection that is Cowboy Bebop. For a lot of anime fans, including myself, it is probably the greatest anime of all time. It's my favorite anime of all time, but then why is that?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             No, seriously, why? I ask that because the show from a critical point of view, Cowboy Bebop should not be that perfect.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             For one thing, it doesn't follow an actual story. I mean look at
             <span id="review56105" style="display: none;">
              we have here: a bunch of bounty hunters on a ship with no real goal other than to collect bounties. Are they trying to accomplish anything big? No, besides one of them is not even an actual bounty hunter but actually an androgynous little girl with excellent hacking skills. That's another thing, Faye only joins because she's a moocher and Ed joins because...(Insert Reason Here) and that's basically it. There is nothing else that these four try to accomplish in their time together.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ...or so they don't think
              <br/>
              <br/>
              You see here's my theory with Cowboy Bebop: The ship is a purgatory. These characters might think they have nothing in common but in reality that's not true. If anything, these characters have one huge big thing in common: They are all not at peace with their inner selves. I guess that's what the beauty of the series is. You are introduced to these characters and discover the kind of people they are and by the end you realize that they have finally discovered what has been plaguing them throughout the whole series leading to a climax that makes you want more but then again is overall a satisfying conclusion to great journey.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So in other words, while there is no real story to Cowboy Bebop, it's all the individual backstories that connect it all into one amazing tale. Maybe that's why I love Bebop a lot, and on top of this, the show gives us a presentation that is beyond unbelievable.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop's most significant trait is its ability to blend so many western genres into one. In one case, there is one episode that tributes Blaxploitation film and another that is a throwback to classic noir films, and the best part about all this that it's actually done extraordinarily well. Plus, for an anime that was released in 1998, visually it really holds up extremely well. Not only does Cowboy Bebop match its genre visually, but it also does it audio-wise. Yoko Kanno's status as one of the greatest composers in anime really shines here (in fact I believe that is the anime she is really known best for). For one thing, just like director Shinichiro Watanabe, she knows how capture the essence of a episode. For example, when the episode calls for Heavy Metal she goes all out, and so on.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Voice acting is great in Japanese, but as any anime fan would know, Cowboy Bebop was the first prime example of how American dubbing got it right. In surprising twist, not only does the English track prove the quality of dubs wrong, but it is also the one of those rare times where an anime's English track is superior to Japanese track. You have Steve Blum as Ice-Cool Spike Spiegel, Wendee Lee as the voluptuous Faye Valentine, Beau Billingslea as the gruff yet fatherly Jet Black, and Melissa Fahn as the hyper and playful Edward (which compared to Aoi Tada makes her more likable then creepy). Four talented voice actors who to this day still get praised for their portrayals. I say if there is only one way to watch Bebop then the English track is only way to go.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So with all this in mind (the surprisingly deep story, the amazing visuals, the pitch-perfect soundtrack, and the absolutely lovable characters), this still doesn't answer the question: what is the one thing that makes Cowboy Bebop, at least to me the pinnacle of anime in general. Well I think if I were to put it simply it would have to be this: It's probably the only anime that actually feels mature when compared to other animes.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sure, Cowboy Bebop has some anime conventions going for it: Edward's presence, Faye's physical anatomy, and character's unrealistic hair colors. However, none of this is forced, if anything, it feels kind of real. This is where the show succeeds, for once I am not sickened by Faye's fan-service, again I'm not annoyed by Ed, Jet while the tough guy really has a heart of gold, nothing about this anime feels over-the-top. When it does go over-the-top (and it does), it's handled carefully and doesn't go so far that it feels out of place in the show. That's why I love Cowboy Bebop the most. Let me tell you something: You might be like me with people judging you for watching anime, with me it's hard to sit in public with my computer open with me watching an episode of I don't know High School of the Dead, however, when I'm watching Cowboy Bebop, I don’t mind who’s glancing over. If anything, I would want them to come over and watch.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              My point is I wish more animes were like Cowboy Bebop. That’s not to say I think all animes are bad because they can’t replicate it, definitely not that at all. My point is rather that I wish anime creators understand what Cowboy Bebop does right in terms of catering to certain audiences. Like I said, High School of the Dead may look and be intended for adults, but then there’s the fact that the show bases itself around gratuitous amounts of gore and well…fan-service, catering to specifically the male demographic of around 16-25.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall, Cowboy Bebop is the highest point of animes. It truly is, at least to me, the greatest anime of all time. It does everything that it wants to do right and it makes watching the show over and over again all the more refreshing. Seriously, I can pop in any episode of this show and have the same reaction I had the first time. Shinichiro Watanabe truly has completed a masterpiece and I believe if you are among the people who haven’t watched this show, then I suggest that you go out and watch it immediately. When you’re done, don’t be afraid to share it with people. Show your friends, show your friends who don’t like anime, show your parents, show your siblings, show your English teacher, I DON’T KNOW JUST DO IT! Also, I suggest you do it now, as in buy a copy of the show now because Bandai Entertainment will soon stop distributing this work of art at least to the U.S. market. Support this show and the anime industry anyway. Believe me when I say out of all the animes you will ever watch in your life, I swear that Cowboy Bebop will be the one you will enjoy no matter what. Even if it doesn’t become your favorite anime, I swear that you will feel satisfied that you have watched it at all. Until then, See You Space Cowboy.

            "Men only think about their past right before death, as if they were searching frantically for proof they were alive." ~Jet Black

             <br/>
             FOREWORD:
             <br/>
             For those of you who have grown up watching good anime your whole life, let me tell you a little secret: there was a time not all that long ago when translated, licensed episodes didn't exist in the U.S. This wasn't just because most people didn't know about it; in reality, the majority of Americans simply weren't interested. Cowboy Bebop changed all that.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             SUMMARY:
             <br/>
             Of all the shows I've ever seen, this one takes the cake. Just because it's old doesn't mean you shouldn't watch
             <span id="review231667" style="display: none;">
              it- in fact, it's pretty difficult nowadays to find anything of a similar caliber amidst the never ending wave of eye-candy garbage that big name companies have begun to produce.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop will lead you on an incredible adventure- one that is certainly full of tasteful humor and suspense, but also possesses an unexpected level of depth and meaning. It will draw you in gently with its art and sound, captivate you with its character development, and move your soul with its plot.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The lighting, angles, and details in the art are unmatched. The music, too, is tasteful and unique, and compliments the atmosphere of each scene exquisitely. Every character is developed meaningfully throughout the show, and their distinct personalities are coordinated in a way that is both refreshing and endearing.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This show will take your breath away. It will open up new vistas of thought, and leave you with a heart that better understands- if only a little- what it truly means to be human.

            Overview-10/10
            <br>
             The story of Cowboy Bebop is the misadventures of a group of space cowboys/bounty hunters with a rift of humor, drama, adventure, action and sci-fi that blend together well with old-time jazz backtracks. From the genius of Shinichiro Watanabe was where this space adventure sprang from and it is an old gem I will always love! And the end is a cliffhanger, leaving you wondering what happened
             <br/>

             Art-10/10
             <br/>
             Watanabe puts some great thought into the appearance of his charachters. They are intricatey designed to fit their persona. Spike Spiegel, our cool-as-ice, sharply dressed hero had a great design with tones of blue and yellow. Perfect compliment!

             <br/>
             The voice
             <span id="review5951" style="display: none;">
              actors in the dub (which I usually watch to get a clear picture in my head for my fanfics) are perfect, for the most part. Steve Blum, one of my all time fave voice actors, plays Spike Spiegel, and Wendee Lee plays the sexy and daring Faye Valentine. Their voices are well-suited. The jazzy backing music made for a mysterious and mellow environment, as well as spazzy chase scenes. The ending theme, the real folk blues

              Charachters-10/10
              <br/>
              The charachters are intricate and have very good backstories, be they major or one timers. Spike's romance with a beautiful blonde and rivalry with an old comerade are riveting to watch.

            What did I think of Cowboy bebop... WELL down right one of my favorite anime's because of its outstanding work on adventure comedy and plots through each episode that always kept me entertained. When i first heard about the anime and its accusations of being one of the best anime's ever by some reviews I was curious about it, what brought me closer is that it was made around the time I myself was born.As I  saw this the plots of each different episode were always there keeping me watching it from begging to end with its awesome music (intro and outro)  written
            <span id="review85489" style="display: none;">
             by Yoko Kanno and performed by the Seatbelts that always had me hyped and so into it. I loved most every aspect of it and would recommend this amazing anime to any searching for a fun comedy, a badass sci fi, or some mystery type deal with a dramatic past. This anime deserves a 10 out of 10 (especially since it was made in 1998)

            This is my First Review! I never watched anime until i took an anime film course last semester and for our research paper we had to choose an anime series. I chose the show Cowboy Bebop as ive heard of its praise, and i was blown away. I was so impressed by the characters, the inner struggles and backstory of Spike, Jet, and Faye and watching them grow and develop was so engaging, the narrative structure was complex and refreshing and it was just so Stylish! from the opening all the way to the end. i wasnt even a fan of jazz until i watched
            <span id="review109211" style="display: none;">
             this show, the jazz/blues theme plays through every scenario in the show and compliments the characters and visuals very well. Cowboy bebop so far is the most Complete story ive seen and i am constantly recommending it to people that refuse to watch anime because they say "its just cartoons", let them watch this they will be impressed. I am now addicted to anime and have watched a couple of shows since this and im glad i was introduced to a whole new genre of tv and film. By the way you will get hooked on the soundtrack so here are some of the names of the songs you will download.
             <br>
              Tank - (opening theme)
              <br>
               Goodnight Julia
               <br/>
               Space lion
               <br/>
               The Real Folk Blues - (end theme)
               <br/>
               .....Your welcome!

            Looking for an anime mixed with futuristic bounty hunters and jazz?  Then this one is for you.  Cowboy Bebop is overall, one of my favorite animes ever.  Perhaps you're saying to yourself, the rating is a bit exaggerated.  But this is not the case, allow me to explain myself.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Story: A very original, and heart-pounding story.  One that tells a story of love, hate, and overall pure excitement!
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Art: Perhaps not the best of it's time, but certainly among them.  Cowboy Bebop delivers very beautiful artwork, especially with all the images of the future.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Sound: Both the Japanese and English tracks were
             <span id="review9391" style="display: none;">
              filled with great voice acting.  Also the sounds hit dead on perfection.  The interesting part about Cowboy Bebop is it's close relation to the jazz genre.  Much enjoyment of the sound from the brilliant artist Yoko Kanno.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Character: This was a huge plus for Cowboy Bebop.  The characters showed a very unique aura in their own way.  Matching very well with the atmosphere of Cowboy Bebop.  Spike being the main protagonist, also showing very mixed emotions showing much humor.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoyment: I very well enjoyed Cowboy Bebop.  Perhaps it was the queer attitude of some characters, or the total hilarious moments.  It's one anime I can watch over and over again, and still enjoy.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall:  Cowboy Bebop is an amazing anime which will hold a place in my heart forever.  Not only did I love it, but it played a big part in my life as well.  It's a great show for people of all ages.  Mixing classic jazz, futuristic bounty hunters, and great fight scenes.  Cowboy Bebop is one anime i would recommend to anyone.
