            I can see why many think that this anime is one of the best off all time.
            <br>
             I really do. Awesome characters, great music, a cool world, interesting philosophical questions...  An anime truly for adults which avoids many of those typical anime cliches. It has also one of the best/most memorable scene I've seen ever in an anime. (Session 5)
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Why is it still not a 10/10 Masterpiece?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The overall story was really lacking which prevented me to be more involved with the characters. And most of of the episodes where just good.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Still its a classic who every anime fan should watch.

            Cowboy Bebop is a legendary anime series made by the legendary studio Sunrise. Cowboy Bebop is often hailed as a masterpiece by the vast majority of people, and I’m no exception. Yeah, I’d usually save the personal side for the end of the “review” but I’m not gonna sugarcoat it, I believe Cowboy Bebop to be a masterpiece. It’s one of the few times I watch something &amp; I have absolutely nothing negative to say about it. So instead of writing a review in the way I usually would, I’m going to do something a little different. I’m instead going to give my top 5
            <span id="review329802" style="display: none;">
             reasons as to what makes Cowboy Bebop just work. Without further ado, lets jam.
             <br>
              <br/>
              Reason number 1 Bebop works, the way in which it does the episodic format.
              <br/>
              Episodic formats are incredibly difficult to get right. The episodic format often suffers from lacking character development, &amp; a formulaic, repetitive nature. Cowboy Bebop has neither of these. Cowboy Bebop’s episodes are largely different from each other. Even though they use the structure of the bebop crew going after a bounty, the setting, scenarios, sequences, etc. Are all different from one another. Going back to the line of “lacking character development”. This is something a lot of episodic shows have, which isn’t always a bad thing provided the series in question gives us characters with enough depth &amp; interesting attributes attached to them, but it can be underwhelming to not see somebody grow. Cowboy Bebop hits the perfect sweet spot of giving us characters with interesting attributes, yet still developing them at the same time. These characters subtly grow as the series goes along, &amp; it’s heavily appreciated.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Reason number 2 Bebop works, Art, Animation, &amp; Attention to detail. So I’m cheating a little bit &amp; doing a 3-for-1 here, but they all tie into one another. Cowboy Bebop has phenomenal artwork that looks like it hasn’t aged a day (aside from the CGI). There’s incredible attention to even the tiniest of details that most viewers wouldn’t even notice that’s how much the team cared about this anime. The animation is also incredibly stellar, there’s a few times where they cheap out a little bit, but 99% of the time Bebop is consistently well animated, even the shots with little movement in them have that attention to the tiniest details that I mentioned earlier. The character art is also spectacular, the choice of colors used for the crew of the Bebop allow them to stand-out &amp; look good in just about any setting.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Reason number 3 Bebop works, the cast of characters, main &amp; side. I’m not going to mention every single character in this segment of the review, but I’ll say it right now, Bebop has a phenomenal cast of side characters. Each &amp; every one of them has something to offer, are interesting characters in their own right, have motivations for what they’re doing &amp; why they’re doing it, if I could sum up the side characters of this show in one word, “Memorable” would be my word of choice.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              But if the main characters aren’t very interesting, then it means nothing. Thankfully, Bebop has a cast of individual &amp; interesting characters. Much like the side characters, Spike, Jet, Faye, &amp; Ed are all given their own backstories, character traits, &amp; personality. Spike is the laid-back one who would rather sit back on the Bebop until something exciting happens. Jet is somewhat of a father figure amongst the crew, keeping everybody in check. Faye is the feminine badass who’s always on the look-out for any money-making opportunity that may come her way. Ed is the comic-relief of the group who’s a computer hacker &amp; teenage genius. What makes these characters just work are not only the dynamics between all of them that the show creates, but the fact that everybody has something to contribute to the show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Reason number 4 Bebop works, the audio department. This is perhaps one of the most important parts to what makes Bebop work, not just its soundtrack, but the voice acting on both sides.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I’ll start out with the music, Bebop makes use of Jazz, Blues, &amp; Bluegrass for its OST. The music itself is not just great on its own, but the show is made around the music. Before anything else, the music for Bebop was created, for god sake “Bebop” which is a form of Jazz is in the title of the anime’s name, music was very important to the series. Yoko Kanno is a name I hope all of you are familiar with, because she’s the one you have to thank for creating this incredibly dynamic soundtrack.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Now onto the voice acting, the voice acting on both sides are phenomenal. The thing with Bebop, it has a much more realistic &amp; grounded nature to its overall tone than most other anime do, despite the fact that Bebop takes place in the future &amp; the characters live in space. So the style of voice acting they would want for this series would be something that sounds natural, almost as if the voice actors were the characters themselves, &amp; Bebop absolutely nailed it. The character dialogue sounds incredibly natural, &amp; you can just tell that the actors were getting into their roles. There’s incredible nuance on both sides. Again, as if the characters themselves are in the studio recording their own lines
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Reason number 5 Bebop works, the way it portrays the reality of its world &amp; handles tone. I’d have to say, my absolute favorite thing about Cowboy Bebop above all else is how it portrays the realities of its world. The characters don’t always win, sometimes they win big, but a lot of the times they don’t, sometimes they half win, half lose. Above all else though, the characters just move on from it, they never dwell on their misfortunes, &amp; neither does the show itself. Life goes on in the Bebop world, &amp; so do the characters along with it, I can’t state enough how much I love this aspect of Bebop.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Another appreciative part of Bebop is how it balances both darkness, &amp; light-heartedness. There are more comedic scenes, &amp; more dark, serious, &amp; somber scenes where character development &amp; world building is usually going on. What makes this work though, is that Bebop not only knows when to use these, but it knows not to go overboard with them. Cowboy Bebop never becomes so laughably dark that you can’t take it seriously, nor does its comedy become overbearing enough to the point where it becomes annoying. So again, just more examples of how balanced Bebop is as a show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Final Thoughts/Overall
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I probably haven’t said enough great things in this review, but if I said every single little thing about what makes this anime work so well, we’d be here all day, &amp; I don’t want to make you guys read a college essay about why some guy on the internet loves Cowboy Bebop so much. I said it at the beginning of the review, but I’ll say it again. Cowboy Bebop is one of the few times I watch a show, &amp; I have absolutely nothing negative to say about it, I don’t even think I could nit-pick something about this series that’s how quality Bebop is. With everything said, Cowboy Bebop is going to receive a deserving 10/10, it’s not my favorite anime, but I’ll be damned if it’s not the most quality anime I’ve ever seen.

            Cowboy Bebop is a hugely influential anime from the late 90s. It was brought to us by Sunrise. Yes, them again. You'd think they'd been around since the 70s and had done a tonne of works. But yes, the Dirty Pair, Gundam, Love Live &amp; Witch Hunter Robin studio is back. Now, I have seen Cowboy Bebop before so I won't be going into it blind. Rather, it'll be one of those series I re-watch. I will say that I remember it being quite good but it's possible that that'll change since it's been about a decade since I saw it last. Let's find out.
            <span id="review282376" style="display: none;">
             <br>
              <br/>
              Story:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              we open with our heroes, Spike &amp; Jet in a state of financial trouble. Fortunately for them, they have a plan to get some credits to their name. They just have to go out and hunt some bounties. This is one of those series where there's not much in terms of an underlying story. Most of the episodes deal with the Bebop crew going on various missions to hunt bounties and they follow a linear path with certain missions very clearly taking place after others.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              One of the most impressive elements in the series is the way it handles tone. Cowboy Bebop has some more comedic portions. It also has some dark and depressing moments and it handles all of them, and the transitions betwixt them, very well. A big part of that is simply that it doesn't go too extreme with either. Its comedic moments are more of the “life can be weird &amp; fun” variety. It avoids the over the top zany type of comedy. And its dark scenes aren't the super dark “we're trying far too hard to be edgy and extreme” type and are more subdued. And that's what the success with tone comes down to, Cowboy Bebop excels at having scenes that feel pretty true to life. In spite of involving a crew of bounty hunters travelling in a space ship and, in a couple cases, science derived super powers. The emotional crux of the scenes, whether jovial or tragic, still feels very relatable
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Let's go into a bit more detail about the episodic nature of the series. Cowboy Bebop is one of those shows that has a lot of ideas for its episodes and does them all really well. There isn't a single episode that I can point to and say “that one wasn't very good.” There's not even one I can point to and say “that one was just good, not great but good.” Then again, this was written by Nobumoto Keiko, who also wrote Wolf's Rain &amp; worked on the script for Tokyo Godfathers. The series also has some interesting, subtle things that are symbolically important. Including Spike's heterochromia which gets brought up fairly early and comes into play for the finale. Incidentally, the finale is absolutely phenomenal. I also really like the way the series does chase sequences. They can be kind of absurd but they hit that sweet spot where they have just the right levels of absurdity &amp; intensity to be amazing.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Let's begin our discussion with the most divisive character in the series, Edward. There are quite a few people in the fan base who don't much care for her because she's a bit childish, weird &amp; generally a high energy “space case.” And you're probably thinking I'm one of those since I don't like children in general but I actually like her quite a bit. I find her to be a pretty delightful character. And I appreciate that she has complexity to her. There are elements to her back story that explain why she is the way she is and she is, in many ways, a prodigy but in others she acts her age. There aren't a lot of child prodigy characters who are still allowed to be children. They're usually shown as prodigies by being far more mature than anyone their age should be. So, I can appreciate this kind of take on it.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The rest of the characters get similar treatment. They have very well developed back stories that you get glimpses of in various missions, eventually having them come into the spotlight for big character moments. These past events also explain a lot of the stranger facets of their personalities and they do have complex, developed personalties. And it's not just the major characters who are multi-faceted &amp; compelling. The major characters they encounter in various missions get the same kind of treatment. To a lesser extent, for obvious reasons but they are brilliantly written characters.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I know I'd normally criticise the fan-service outfits, but I can't really in this case. See, they do play up Faye's sexiness a bit with her outfit and such, but they do it in ways that actually suit her character and they do show restraint even in the most risqué scenes. So, I can't really complain about it. Because Faye isn't a practical minded woman so you don't really expect her to dress in practical attire. It's not often I encounter a series that manages to have fan-service elements but makes them work and shows class with them.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The backgrounds and sci-fi dressings are fantastic. The action sequences, particularly in the last episode are phenomenal and the character designs are memorable for all the right reasons. And Ein is absolutely adorable. I want to pat his furry little head.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              If a certain other popular sci-fi series gave us Hayashibara Megumi's worst performance, this easily gives us one of her best. And it's not just her. Tada Aoi, Yamadera Kouichi, Ishizuka Unshou, Wakamoto Norio and many, many actors for side characters are all fantastic in this.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This series also has some of the best music I've heard in an anime. And not jut because the beats are thoroughly solid but because it's very good at using its incidental music to add that perfect final touch to any given action sequence. There are times where you're watching the action get started and the music kicks in at just the right time to elevate the scene beyond what it could possibly achieve with visuals alone. In fact, it happens a lot.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Ho-yay:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              There's a little bit. They encounter some gay guys during missions. I have to say, I appreciate that Spike's reaction to a man hitting on him is just an awkward disinterest in the dude. There are too many things that play up an exaggerated disgust in that kind of situation instead of having the character handle it like an adult.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Final Thoughts:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Those of you who are familiar with my work know that I won't praise something solely because it's popular. In this case, I am going to join with the majority and sing the praises of this series. It's easily among the best science fiction works I've seen.. It just does everything really damn well and with very little room for improvement. For my final rating, I have to go with a full 10/10.  Next week, D-Frag.

            [REVIEW WITHOUT SPOILERS]
            <br>
             Cowboy Bebop, a true classic with some so-so's.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             THE GOOD'S:
             <br/>
             * SOUND: 12/10. Really, can you only give 10 out of 10 for the music here? In Cowboy Bebop, it's the music that takes the stage, and sets the atmosphere of the anime. Music sets the environment, the mood, the spirit, and really makes the anime oozing class. Remember this name: Yoko Kanno, the true musical genius behind. Many times, before or after an episode, I just left the dvd menu on to listen to one of the many terrific tracks. This is really the number one anime of all time as far as soundtrack
             <span id="review309958" style="display: none;">
              is concerned, period.
              <br/>
              * ART: 9/10. The art is very nice and enjoyable, and marries well with the soundtrack. Consider it is a '98-'99 series, and you see right away how the art is even more remarkable given the time. In any case, even today, it stands very well and helps a lot to define the atmosphere of the series.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              THE SO-SO's:
              <br/>
              * CHARACTER development and STORY, 6 to 7 on average, more on single episodes.
              <br/>
              Some characters are somehow well defined, others are less defined, and this is not helped at all by the story development, which is hardly sufficient.
              <br/>
              The plot goes on using single episodes, self-contained stories: while this helps the casual viewer, and makes for some epic single episodes, it doesn't provide a sufficiently deep storyline, which is a pity given the other merits of this anime. The same ending is rather disappointing, showing that the story writers somehow "had to" finish the show, while it absolutely deserved better. It left me a bitter aftertaste, for all the potential not fullfilled.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              OVERALL: With its good's and so-so's, this is anyway a classic, must-watch for everyone interested in anime. Sure, it could have been even better, but even with its pitfalls it is a beautiful and innovative series, worth staying in the top's of anime history, and that didn't age.
              <br/>
              Watch it and, even more, listen!

            These are just my vague thoughts about the show, not particularly organized or backed up with specific details from the show itself.  Probably not the best way to write a review, but I am basically just here to praise the show and state what I liked :]
            <br>
             <br/>
             Amazing series.  Despite the fact it's episodic, you can see a connected story line through the characters and the way they and their relationships develop.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I truly loved every character on the Bebop-- they all filled different roles without seeming forced.  They all had pasts that affected them even if we don't ever fully learn what
             <span id="review52597" style="display: none;">
              their past is.  Character relationships and growth are what I look for in a series, and this one nailed it.  Also, this series has Edward!  Can anybody NOT love her?  I don't think so.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop had a really nice mix of humor, seriousness, darkness, and suspense.  The jokes and the banter between the characters always felt genuine and made me smile.  The show really knew how to have silly moments while still remaining mature.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I am not a big fan of tons of action and gun fights or space-themed things.  But this series made me like it.  It made it believable--  the story's universe was built so well that everything felt real while watching it.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The show can be appreciated for the individual episodes as well as the overall themes, the biggest of which is whether or not your past makes you who you are.  An over-done theme, perhaps, but Bebop's take on it was really well done because you could see it from so many points of view.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I'm not one to normally notice soundtracks because I am so focused on the story and the visuals, but Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack definitely stuck out to me.  I loved it.  The music always helped improve the scenes and the mood and was never a distraction.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The art is unique and beautiful in its own way, especially from being nearly 15 years old now.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In the end, I would recommend this series to anyone and everyone.  It started off slow for me but when I took the time and patience to appreciate it, I couldn't turn it off.  I definitely think there's a lot of rewatch value in the series as well, and I can't wait to show it to more people.

            The short ass review:
            <br>
             I love this show. 10/10
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The actual review:
             <br/>
             I love me some 90's anime, its quite good. I could go on for ages on how much I goddamn love this show. I could be a grown ass man by the time I'm done. But instead, I'll give a short 5 paragraph version of why I love this show.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop takes place in space with 2 bounty hunters (Spike &amp; Jet) making cash off killing people. Later on they find a bad-ass women (Faye), a person who still after 17 years, nobody has any idea of it's sex (Edward) and a goddamn dog. We're
             <span id="review211252" style="display: none;">
              given enough information to work with for these characters as we meet them. It's not too much nor too little. As the show goes on, we delve deeper and deeper into the characters as we learn about their pasts. And that's really what the show revolves around, the history of a bounty hunter (Spike Spiegel) who has done a lot of bad shit which I won't talk about cause duh, spoilers. But it is real emotional. It even gets emotional for the other characters.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I love every character in this show, extra, side, main, doesn't matter. Each character has a personality and a backstory to them. Spike is a wise man with badass karate moves, life lessons and generally a backstory to cry over. Jet, man, who doesn't wanna be this guy? He's just cool and chill, he gets the job done, handles situations. Just a cool character. Faye Valentine is really a broken character who is trying to learn her past. And when you do learn it, you feel so sad for this character. Edward is wacky and love them. Enough said.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The animation is really well done even for a  1999 anime. For being some of the last anime to use hand drawn animation, it really is impressive. The music, ah. Man, the music. It's a mix of jazz and blues. Fuck me it's amazing. Each track is filled to the brim with amazing music. The opening is orgasmic and the ending is calming and just a beauty.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall, this show is just bad-ass. That's the one word I can say about this show. It has good storytelling, likable characters, superb animation and orgasmic music. If I can say a couple of minor issues. The first 4 episodes are extremely slow paced and try to introduce you to the show, but trust me. It sure may be a little boring, but after those 4 episodes. Episodes 5 &amp; 6 are simply not only some of the best episodes of the show, but the best episodes in all of anime and TV. That's the only complaint I have with this show. So please, do yourself a favor and go watch this masterpiece. Also, watch the English dub, this is one of the only times I prefer dub over sub.

            "Just a cowboy ma'am"
            <br>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop is most likely one of the most famous anime out there. And it is, for very good reasons. It's a classic, and one of the first anime with a good English dub. The anime takes place in the future, following the adventures of Spike and Jet, bounty hunters (or cowboys) looking for cash. As they go about their adventures, they pick up a lady (Faye Valentine), a dog (Ein), and a boy (who's really a girl named Ed). Many things happen to them, and you eventually learn more about Spike and his interesting background.

             While having what is IMO
             <span id="review137261" style="display: none;">
              the best ending possible in any anime, it has too many filler episodes that don't have anything to do with the actual plot. This would be fine, if they actual episodes were very good, but some of them have barely anything to do with hunting down criminals, such as the one where they purchase some sketchy mushrooms. Otherwise the main plot line of the show is amazing, and the ending wraps it all up very nicely. The backstory of some of the characters is also what makes this show fantastic.

              <br/>
              Even though it is a very old show, it still stands up there as one of the best drawn anime I've ever seen. The animation during fights is fantastic, especially for it's time and I've never seen anything like it when I first saw it on T.V. Characters are well drawn with realistic features, nothing too exaggerated like most animes nowaday.

              Sound - 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Oh boy, where do I even start. This show has what I want to say the best soundtrack of any anime I've ever seen in my entire life. Maybe it's my bias because it's one of the first anime I've ever seen, but The Seatbelts did an amazing job and the ending theme song (The Real Folk Blues) is one of my favorite songs of all time. I constantly hum it almost all the time in fact, and some of my colleagues have even been interested to know here it is from.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              And the English dub is one of the first best ones out there. I really felt the emotions in this dub unlike most other dubs which are just bland. However, this one definitely stands out in terms of english dub quality.

              <br/>
              While the show did an amazing job developing Spike's and Jet's characters, I felt that Vicious and the others could've been done a little better. I still felt like I wanted to know more about them, but sadly the show didn't deliver on that aspect. However, for sure, they did an amazing job for what they did develop.

              Enjoyment - 10/10

              <br/>
              I love this anime. It's another of the ones that I grew up with, and it still sticks with me even today. It was the show that really stood out to me, and probably the one that got me into watching even more anime. Even after re-watching it recently, I still felt compelled to watch it again because that's how I much I enjoyed it. The fight scenes were splendid, the ending stunning, soundtrack fantastic, there was almost no downsides, and for the ones that it has, it makes up for two fold.

            Ok, I knew this was an episodic anime going into it. I'm not the biggest fan of those but with everything I've heard about the show and how great it is I decided to give it a go. First couple episodes were pretty good so I thought 'I can get through this.' Cut to ep. 15 and now I'm struggling to finish it. The sound and dub are amazing, I'm not denying that but the story suffers majorly here. There's no real over arcing story line other than Faye's story and Spike's and even then they are really only mentioned in the second half with
            <span id="review219635" style="display: none;">
             everything else feeling like they're fillers. The animation was nice with it before the digitization age with it feeling dark and everything with no real noticeable flaws.

              When we first see Julia and thereafter, I couldn't of cared less about her even after everything. I knew nothing about her or anything. Spike's backstory was jammed into the last two episodes with a couple hints throughout the anime so when the final two episodes happened it just seemed out of the blue which might be why I was so annoyed at the ending. I thought that something else was going to happen and it didn't.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I especially didn't care didn't care about Edward. When she left I couldn't help but cheer. What was the point to her character being on Bebop? I couldn't understand. Yes, she's a hacker but that's all. And the way she spoke rubbed me the wrong way and felt so childish and out of place in the show. Not to mention she wasn't there for very long so again, I wondered what her purpose there was.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Faye was amazing. I know some people don't like her but I enjoyed her character especially after we learn parts of her backstory which made her more intriguing in my mind. Her character was consistent through the show but there was some character development which was nice (unlike Edward). I couldn't help but laugh at her and Spike going back and forth.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Jet is an interesting one because even though he owns the ship Spike seemed to be the one in charge-most of the time. Jet will put his foot down and argue if he has to. There's a few other things that I can't think of right now but suffice to say I enjoyed him.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Spike...pretty much a walking contradiction until the last couple episodes but I won't grip about that here. He can be ruthless but compassionate. He tells Faye to stop living in the past when that's all he does and so forth.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The show down between him and Vicious felt cheap I'm not going to lie but it did. The very ending I wasn't expecting but again, I felt a but cheated with how quick everything went. If that story line was the over arcing one throughout the whole series and that finale was stretched to three episodes instead of two than I think it could have worked better and flesh out Vicious a bit more because I couldn't of care less when the fight was going on since he didn't really seem like a villain to me. Maybe it's because I didn't watch the movie but he didn't really do it for me as a bad guy.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall, if you like Bebop that's good. I had trouble with it because it was so light humoured until the last couple episodes so the tone was everywhere and it was purely episodic. Not to mention some of the characters did it in for me so I can gladly say I watched it but probably won't be one I'll rewatch.

            Cowboy Bebop is by far my favorite anime. Its got a great story that keeps the viewer entertained, laughing, and at some parts on the verge of tears that said I would like to say that I love the jazzy kinda dark feel of the overall anime and think that it was done very well. On the other hand I feel like it was pretty short... which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing because they didn\'t milk it for every dime like some newer anime but It leaves the viewer yearning for more.

            I hazard to award any series a full-blown ten, as I see the ranking more as a place to compare everything else to than an actual spot where anything belongs. Unless it's Cowboy Bebop...
            <br>
             <br>
              The episodic structure gradually reveals more and more about the characters while bouncing between tones and still being able to be taken as seriously or silly as it wants. With a plot that isn't exceptionally complicated, the pacing and delivery manages to make it exceptionally compelling.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The visual style screams "cool" with fights given loving attention and characters moving around and interacting with interesting worlds.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The music...
              <br/>
              Sublime standing by itself, the Seatbelts
              <span id="review123553" style="display: none;">
               blend of jazzy cool, contemporary mixes, and some American cowboy couldn't be imitated and hasn't been done since.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The characters are excellently portrayed and acted, with personalities that are crystal clear and enjoyable to watch. I honestly can't think of much else to say that won't come across as gushing; they're superb!
               <br/>
               <br/>
               This series blew so many standard prejudices I had against anime out of the water. Here is an anime, where less is more. Less talking, less byzantine plots, less tacked-on elements, just tons of atmosphere and personality. Truly the bearer of the cup of which to baptize neophyte western Otaku, Cowboy Bebop is a series I cherish to revisit alone and with friends, and plan to do so for many years to come.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Now I just have to wait for one of those $300+ blue-ray collections to fall into my lap and get Steve Blum to sign it...

             There's something about this anime that sets itself apart from everything else out there. From its amazing atmosphere to its near-flawless character design, this anime is a surefire way to make a boring weekend a lot less boring. I had heard so much about this show from many different sources, but I had never tried to watch it. Only because of a sudden urge to watch anime was I able to fully grasp how good this show is.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Let me just say that the intro is definitely something to drool over like some mindless fanboy. And I don't say that often. A good intro may
             <span id="review186032" style="display: none;">
              not affect the story, but it can really draw in viewers.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Take a look for yourself (Don't worry, it's just an intro. No spoilers here. I DO have a heart, you know.)
              <br/>

              <br/>
              <br/>
              SOUND:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              9/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The soundtrack really is unique, and I haven't seen anything else quite like it. It can go from smooth and classy to quick and dangerous in a matter of a few seconds and you wouldn't know what hit you. The soundtrack alone is a good reason why you should watch this anime.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ART:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              9/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As for the art? It might be a bit outdated, but... you know, that's because it came out in 1998. But even for its release date, it showed an exceptional amount of care and passion. The little details were what drew me in, not to mention the downright awesome fight scenes. It's clear there was a lot of dedication that went into this anime and I applaud the makers. Kudos.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              STORY: (Obvious spoilers.)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              While the story might seem everywhere to some people, it's clearly meant to be that way. Each story arc offered a unique setting and progression. From an intelligent dog comparable to a human being to a pathogen bomb that has the ability to wipe out an entire population on a planet, you're in for a ride, folks. But I don't want to spoil any more for you. Just know that you'll be missing out if you don't watch this anime.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              CHARACTERS: (Yes. Take all of my virtual yes.)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The character design and progression is something I rarely see in shows nowadays, excluding some of the more successful shows out there. Those are successful for a reason. I particularly love the smooth personality of the main character, and the uncle-like friendliness (While still possessing copious amounts of badassary) of his companion. There are a few more notable characters, but I'll leave them to you to discover.
              <br/>

              ENJOYMENT?:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Yes. I enjoyed it. If you haven't already figured that out, then you have now. 10/10, would fangasm over again.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Nuff' said, really.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              OVERALL:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              10/10.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Watch this anime. You won't regret it.

            Although i would say that i am disappointed due to Cowboy Bebop having such prestigious reputation in the anime community. I felt that even though it's variety in aesthetic, tone, theme and story within it.
            <br>
             <br/>
             This variety made the narrative's quality and also adding to the fact that it is an episodic series but more constraints on how the show can be fleshed out making it more simplistic. Simplicity does not equal bad it's just that i prefer having story's with plot threads that all build on top of each other and connect to a single conclusion.

             Regardless to say it still was an enjoyable
             <span id="review324225" style="display: none;">
              ride with its phenomenal music that have elements of jazz and blues, punchy and crisp animation that filled my Sunday nights of chilling and relaxing to some cowboy bebop episodes.

            Cowboy Bebop is a triumph of budget; a paper-thin anime with dynamic, fluid animation, a lovingly crafted eclectic soundtrack, and stylistic nuances for miles (one episode even effectively parodies blaxploitation). I don't mean that in an entirely derogatory way; it's really no surprise this is one of the major things that got people into Japanese animation, because it's an extremely fully realized show, so fully realized in fact that it's easy to overlook broad, undeveloped characters and a fanservice-vehicle female character who's dressed like a space hooker most of the time. There's not much to it, and yet there is.

            What to say about this anime that hasn't already been said?
            <br>
             I finished CB not so long ago, and it quickly became my favorite anime so far, and for very good reasons.
             <br>
              <br/>
              Story: 9/10
              <br/>
              The storytelling in this anime is one of its crowning achievements. It follows the crew of the Bebop and their struggle to make a living out of bounty hunting, showing a different "case" in almost every episode. There's a criminal on the loose, they go out to get him, at some point things go wrong (no wonder there's a recurrent theme of luck/lack of luck in this show) and after all they've done
              <span id="review191313" style="display: none;">
               they either get a very small bounty, waste it all in one day, or get nothing at all. It sounds comical and even repetitive, but trust me, it's not. And that's because CB is a character-driven show - each of this "cases" serve to reveal a thing or two about the main characters, and how they deal with their past, which is, for most of them, pretty tragic. The "main" plot, however, is focused on Spike Spiegel, his forbidden romance, his downfall and his ascension. And it is beautifully done. It doesn't rely on clichés to get an emotional reaction out of you, it does not spoonfeed you with everything you need to know, it follows the "show, don't tell" rule to a tee... BUT exactly because of that it can also be a little slow in the beginning, so you have to be aware of that when you decide to watch it.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Characters: 9/10
               <br/>
               The one word I can say to describe the characters in Cowboy Bebop is REAL. They look and feel real. My biggest surprise was Faye Valentine. At first she looks like a shallow woman who's willing to do anything to survive, but as the plot progresses and you get to know her past, you notice how complex she actually is. I was only a little disappointed with the lack of focus given to Ed, who could've been a little more developed, and Julia, who felt to me was just there to be Spike's love interest. Vicious, the main villain, also felt a bit cliché. Apart from that, most of the characters, including Spike, of course, are brilliant and very well developed. And I'm not talking only about the main characters. A lot of the side characters are also very interesting and memorable.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Art: 10/10
               <br/>
               This anime was made in 1998, and it has better art than many anime from the 2010's. This is certainly something. The animation is incredibly fluid, the colors are spot on... I really have no complaints AT ALL in this area.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Sound: 10/10
               <br/>
               CB's soundtrack is one of its most famous aspects, and rightly so. It's very unique and varied, with songs ranging from jazz to bossa nova (!). Yoko Kanno's score brings personality to a very music-oriented show, making an already memorable scene become even more memorable. I still listen to some of the songs in this soundtrack daily. That's how good it is.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Enjoyment: 9/10
               <br/>
               Like I mentioned before, Cowboy Bebop has a rather slow start. But it gets better, and even at its most "boring" moments, it has a level of intrigue that will make you come back to it and eventually enjoy it a lot. It's definitely a very rewatchable show, and it gives a lot of "food for thought" too.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Overall, there's nothing else for me to say about this anime. It's a MASTERPIECE, in every sense of the word, and a definite must-watch for anime fans, and even for those who don't like anime.
               <br/>
               Cowboy Bebop is a 10/10!
               <br/>
               <br/>
               See You Space Cowboy!

            Cowboy Bebop is one of the few series that got recommended to me by both my real life friend and my net friends. I really wanted to like this show, I was so excited to watch this and my expectations were at an all time high which is what led me to dub cowboy bebop as the most disappointing anime ever
            <br>
             <br/>
             There are definitely worse, much worse series out there of course but I never expected much from them. Cowboy bebop however, is one of the most loved anime and everything I heard about it was positive which ultimately led me to expect Cowboy Bebop to
             <span id="review225154" style="display: none;">
              be an masterpiece that cannot be hated by anyone. Boy was I wrong
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Well, that's enough of that, let's get on with my review
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Story:
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is episodic for the most part and what's worse is that it's pretty much in the monster of the week format. There are a lot of standalone episodes in the series that aren't really important but they tried to force it at the end. I didn't like most of the standalone episodes but I hated what they did at the end even more
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters:
              <br/>
              They were able to give the most of the main cast a believable back story which properly explained why they acted the way they did. Not much of Ed's past is revealed though like why she even knew how to hack and what motivates her to act the way she does. They could've inserted that anywhere given how much standalone episodes they have but they didn't
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art and Animation:
              <br/>
              I don't really mind the art style but some of the scenes just took me out of the anime because of how terribly animated they were but this can be forgiven because this is a 90s anime. The animation for the wormholes in particular were absolutely nauseous
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound:
              <br/>
              I'm not a fan of Jazz so I have nothing to say about the music
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoyment:
              <br/>
              This is one of the few anime where I actually had to push myself just to finish. I usually just drop them but given how highly acclaimed the series I held on unto hope that maybe, just maybe the next episode would be better and it wouldn't bore me out of my mind but no, that didn't happen and when I finished this series, I was just glad that it was finally over and I can finally watch something that I actually like. This series was boring from start to finish, the only exception being episode 8, the sole episode that I like
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall:
              <br/>
              It's not as good as people make it out to be and it failed to live up to my expectations but most importantly, and when I say most importantly, I mean that this is the only part that matters for me, it was boring and I didn't enjoy it which is why I'm going to give this a 6.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Oh hey I just checked but my overall score for Cowboy Bebop is still a 6 if i take the average of my scores for it's separate aspects. 6.25 if I didn't count my score for the music (I divided it by 4 ofc, I'm not that dumb)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I don't think numbers can properly convey how much you like or dislike a show so take this sentence as my rating:
              <br/>
              It still had some bits that I enjoyed but it was really boring as a whole.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              P.S. This is ofc just my opinion so don't send me death threats for this, okay? Cool?

            I watched it because everyone said it is a masterpiece and must to watch but it ended up being disappointing.
            <br>
             The overall anime is good and it had promise to be even better. In my point of view it had way too many pointless filler episodes and didn't really find good balance between being serious and laughable. I felt like the seriousness of the whole story was bit diminished by the fact that there were so many episodes just for laugh and giggles.
             <br/>
             I think that this anime would have been way better with a little bit more serious tone. It let me a bit
             <span id="review219658" style="display: none;">
              confused. Not bad anime by any means. Its just,,,I expected it to be bit better.

            I will get heat for saying this is how I truly feel. Cowboy Bebop is good but overrated for me. First of all, the characters, artwork, music, sound effects were absolutely incredible and way ahead of it's time. SHOUT OUT TO THE THEME SONG!!!! But the story just didn't do it for me. The main villain I felt was not developed enough to make me care about him and it's because of this, the conflict between the protagonist and antagonist just didn't resonate. I will say the final episode was very well done and entertaining but in the end, I couldn't help but feel unsatisfied
            <span id="review202598" style="display: none;">
             by the whole show. I can't say in my right mind that I'd recommend it to everyone. For people who love episodic shows, this is as close to heaven as you can get. But for some that don't love that sort of format, I'd recommend to at least give it a shot as there is some high quality material to be found here. In the end, it was still an enjoyable experience and that's why I give it a 7.

              Cowboy Bebop has been praised by fans and critics as the greatest anime of all-time, it set a benchmark in the 90s for animation quality, has some of the best storytelling ever written and is one of the most influential anime ever.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The show is episodic by nature but has enough backstory in each character to give an over arching view. Focusing in on the Bebop crew and their not so successful bounty hunting adventures Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed make up four of the greatest anime characters ever. They each bring something amazing to the show. Ed the super hacker adds a light hearted
              <span id="review157367" style="display: none;">
               element to the show that never seems to slow down or hurt the show in any way like so many other comic relief characters do, Jet the ex cop turned bounty hunter is kind of the father figure in the group, Faye the lovable gambling addict from the past who acts as a counter part to Spike and Spike... oh Spike, probably the coolest anime character ever, how do you not love this guy? he fights like Bruce Lee, has an amazing shot, has a dope backstory, is a total badass and has said some of the most icon quotes in anime history.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The animation is some of the best I've ever seen, backgrounds are detailed, the characters designs are all very unique, the fights flow like water and oh ya this is all hand drawn animation! no cheep tricks or cutting corners every frame of this show is absolutely flawless. The soundtrack on it's own is nice but coupled with the show is like the best anime soundtrack ever.it reminds me of Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece Taxi Driver in how the music seems to fuse so well with the visuals to give the viewer a one of a kind experience.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Overall Cowboy Bebop is one of the greatest shows ever (anime or not), it has aged like scotch and is a must see for any and every anime fan. Until next time, see you space cowboy

            I first watched Cowboy Bebop: Knocking on Heaven's door a couple years back and felt genuinely engaged throughout the movie and regretted that it had to end. I had absolutely no idea there was a fantastic piece of artwork in the form of an anime series behind this titular film. Ironically, as I watched Cowboy Bebop I found myself humbly involved with the series to the point that I would pause between episodes to really soak in this fantastic show. It is a genre in itself and never insists that it is. It is a fantastic chronicle of people experiencing an extraordinary lifestyle, but also
            <span id="review14207" style="display: none;">
             dealing with the normal challenges life brings. This series was dedicated to those special moments in your life when you say to yourself in the back of your mind "this is worth it, this is me embracing the moment". Of course these feelings are fleeting, which only makes them more cherishable, much like the brief run of this spectacular series.
             <br>
              <br/>
              The series takes place in the future. Earth has been plagued by freak technological accident and much of the population has expanded to the various planets in the solar system. Each planet is like a whole other world, which are slightly expanded upon during each adventure for the crew of the bebop. The bebop first has only Jet and Spike, bounty hunters looking for work only so they can fill their stomachs. Jet comes from a policing background, which has given him a reputation as the "black dog" who never releases his bite on a case. This gives him a sense of authority and father like actualities throughout the series. His partner, and the main character, Spike, comes from a mysterious past with ties to a crime syndicate known as the Red Dragon. He has since pulled out of the syndicate after realizing that it didn't make him "alive". He plans to be with his true love Julia, but circumstances arise between him and his long time rival Vicious, the only recurring antagonist of the series. As such, Jet and Spike get along well with one another since they are both trying to look ahead instead of behind. As they continue their journeys they meet various people during missions who seem to encapsulate various life experiences in their characters. Love, anguish, betrayal, obsession, loneliness, if only to name a few. Its as if the bounty is only the outer coating to much more involved lessons which are shown through the most subtle of gestures, much like in the real world, where it is hard to really know if something has impacted you until its over Jet and Spike soon meet Faye and Ed, two girls with mysterious pasts. Faye gradually learns of her past albeit at the end of the series at which point she lets down her guard to realize her true home is on the bebop. Ed presents herself as a zainy hacking genius, but she also has ties with her estranged father, which has caused her to wander frequently. WIth the ship's local canine Ein, Ed often makes ideas more clear to viewers through her childlike comedy by shouting them out is crazy ways. All four of these crew members embark on a series of encounters with various bounties. The story is moving on all levels, and remained the least bit contrived throughout, The great thing was the combination of most genres. There was not set plot or motif, which made all of the action and humor more engaging. The viewer is made to care about each exploit because they don't know what to expect on a structural level, but are still able to take tide and true knowledge with them after each stint.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The animation for the series was clearly defined and realistic, with each character being drawn in a way to reveal their personalities on a physical level. Jet is older, more experienced, with receding hair and armor to match. Spike is spontaneous and subtle at the same time, with wild hair and an ironically neat suit to match it. Faye is sexually involving but tough as nails. She is stubborn and selfish, enhanced by her look at me wardrobe. Ed's clothing is enhanced by her unpredictability. You don't really know what to think of her clothing since their it is so basic and childlike. This simplicity allows Ed to be more Astonishing. This pattern of art is seen throughout the character spectrum. All of the worlds are their own and match their tones. Just awesome.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The music for the series was absolutely insane. Each episode is known as a session and essentially the series is rooted from music itself. Every encounter has a soundtrack that enhances the feelings being portrayed in the episode. If its metal, its probably a tense situation, if its jazz, past regrets are being felt, if its classical, love is expressed. This coupled with the beautiful art only makes the story more impacting on a whole other level!??! The whole spectrum of this anime is seen with these combinations of sound and art! Also, each episode title refers to the type of music played throughout.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The characters in this series are the enjoyment factor. The crew of the bebop is so subtle with their affections that it seems like they've been a family for years. At times they don't even care about what the other is doing because it seems vindictive but the subtext is that they do care...so much so that they don't because they know thats just who the other person is. Its a whole other realm of trust that is so true in real life. Like I said earlier, if you couple the family crew of the bebop with influential characters on different worlds with their own messages, it makes it seem like the family learns something together, which makes the viewer learn something from four different angles. All of their actin and humor towards their bounty targets and eachother is hilarious and touching, and just pure entertainment.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I will never regret the time I spent watching, learning, and ultimately living from Cowboy Bebop.

            My First Review ever so bare with me
            <br>
             <br/>
             Well I'm not even going to sugarcoat the fact that Cowboy Bebop was a big letdown for me. I was expecting so much from this series due to everyone hyping it up. But, I was left with underdeveloped characters, beyond idiotic actions from characters, and no one listening to Jet.... EVER. Despite all of this, there were some redeeming factors to this animes such as the music, funny scenarios, and just overall enjoyment.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Story:7
             <br/>
             This shows all about the realtionship of a crew consisting of Spike, Ed, Jet, Faye, and little ole' Ein. Just a couple of "bounty hunters" (and
             <span id="review180426" style="display: none;">
              a dog) going from bounty to bounty, and how their pasts sort of catches up with them. Nothing special here really, It's whatever.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art:8
              <br/>
              I'm going to say this first off, I'm not the best judge when it comes to things such as art and animation but there were no problems with either of those in this anime. Pretty solid overall in my opinion.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound:10
              <br/>
              This would be the entire anime's strongpoint in my opinion. The names of the episodes would be based off of genres, songs, and albums (ex: Asteroid Blues &amp; Ballad of the Fallen Angels) and the music in each episodes sorta correlates to name of the episodes. The soundtrack mainly consists of Jazz and Blues music. These songs/insturmentals always added to the scenes and made them better than they actually were. A fight scene was turned into an AMAZING scene and a sad scene turned into a HEART-WRENCHINGLY SAD SCENE. The music was what made me keep watching this anime.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Character:6
              <br/>
              Now his was the weak point of the anime for me. There were so many times where I wanted to know more about the characters like Ed or Ein, or Jet. There was literally no info given about Ed and Ein, they got no love. They were there to lighten up the series yet I know nothing about them. Jet was like the overprotective father of the group and I like that, but NO ONE AND I MEAN NO ONE EVER LISTENED TO HIM. Dang it as so annoying, like there would be CLEAR danger in their way and Jet would give some sound advice but all Faye and Spike wanted to do was die with a bang like HOLY. And Spike was EXTREMELY irrational and idiotic  to the point where it was eye aching. The reason for his innjuries 100% of the time was because he just went on his stupidity, no not instict, but stupidity. His character was cool at first but after a while he reminded me of a rebelious teenager who's overdramatic. Faye was alright, her back story was kinda sad but they explained so quickly I had to deep connection with her. Then there's Jet, not much too say really. He gets one episode of backstory for himself and done. We do get a LITTLE and when I say little i mean minuscule insight from other episodes about his past life, but again that's it.

              Enjoyment:8
              <br/>
              Now even though the characters pissed me off, they did have their badass moments. Especially with his knack to use the environment to his advantage and his smooth fighting style. The funny moments with Ein and Ed were also a nice addition. Again, those moments really lightened up the show when it was getting depressing and dark. Also the conversations between people were also pretty hilarious to say the least
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall: 7.5
              <br/>
              Although I did get irritated at A LOT of moments in Cowboy Bebop it was still fairly enjoyable. The music also stepped the anime up a notch on my scale because of how good it was at enhancing the scene rather than take you away from it or kill it entirely. There no problems with art and animation either. In my opinion, this show doesn't live up to the hype in the slightest, It was underwhelming throughout the entire series in my opinion. Although, that ending was pretty sad. If you want to go watch this classic, go ahead, just don't go in with high expectations. REMEMBER NO OF THIS IS FACT, IT'S ALL MY OPINION.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              P.S. I may have been a little nit picky with this anime but it was because I actually wanted to look at all aspects of the anime while watching it instead of just blindly watching it and giving it a 10 without knowing exactly what I enjoyed/disliked.
