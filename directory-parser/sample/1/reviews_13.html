             <br/>
             In the year 2071, much of the world has transferred to different planets and space crafts. Our two main characters: Spike and Jet, are bounty hunters, tracking down bounties and delivering the targets to the police to make money.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop is a collection of stories with a arcing story throughout the whole series.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Most of the stories are very well written and very dark and intense. What might put off some viewers is how slow the episodes are. Some episodes drag for little bit too long. But this recovered for the most part with episodes that are action packed and really fun.

              Bebop is very stylistic and gritty. The characters designs are very unique, and each character looks very different.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The whole style is also very reminiscent of noir movies from the 40s and 50s. The noir theme really gives the show its own identity.

              The soundtrack for the anime is fantastic. The show uses jazz very effectively to add to the atmosphere. The opening theme "Tank" is one of the most iconic anime themes ever and for good reason, its catchy and lets you know what you are getting into.

              Cowboy Bebop features one of the best dubs ever made. At many times its better the Japanese dub. The voices match perfectly to characters.

              The characters in Cowboy Bebop make the show really fun to watch. The characters are:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Spike, the closest character we have to a main character. He has an dark past and wants to run away from it. He has a fun personality with quick dialogue. Definitely one of the best characters.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Jet, he's the captain of the Bebop and is an ex-police officer. He has a fake arm and legs. He's very stern but also very quick and clever. He has very good dialogue with Spike and is great because of it.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Faye, coming in at episode 3, throughout the whole series Faye is probably the one who grows the most. She is cocky and mean. But really is a good person. It's always fun seeing how she is going to get out of a situation.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Edward, coming in at episode 9, Edward is 13 year old girl, who is a computer hacker and loud mouth. She is quite annoying in some cases, yet fine in others. She's a very mixed bag and feels a little out of place.

              Cowboy Bebop is a classic, and a anime that nobody should miss. That said it isn't perfect and has many problems. My enjoyment went up and down as the series went on. But the ending is one of the best anime endings and I did feel satisfied when it ended.

            The year is 2071. Humanity has long since expanded into space, with civilization taking hold in various ways on a large selection of the different rocky bodies throughout the solar system. Luckily, we were already in the middle of this process when a hyperspace gateway near the Earth exploded, leaving the planet in ruins and virtually uninhabitable. It’s been fifty years since then, but we can still feel the effect of the disaster. Our colonies range from big, busy cities to smaller, less affluent townships that you’d swear were taken right out of the old west. Interspace travel means nothing to most folk, who were
            <span id="review250119" style="display: none;">
             born and raised and eventually expired on the same planet, hell, maybe even in the same town. Sure, those who chose the life of a transportation or delivery pilot may see a couple of different planets, and those rich enough to travel may have seen a few different sunrises, but if you’ve been everywhere, seen every shade of civilization, felt the grass and dirt of multiple planets beneath your feet, then you’re either a criminal... Or a Bounty Hunter.
             <br>
              <br/>
              Yeah, it turns out that with so much ground to cover, the central government can’t be bothered to uphold the law in every society, nor to keep up with wanted criminals who could be hiding out on any number of worlds. Thus, we’ve seen the rise of the registered bounty hunters, people who’ve taken on the job of tracking down and apprehending those with a high enough price on their head and delivering them to the authorities. It’s a job that offers you freedom, excitement, and the right to be your own boss, provided you’re successful enough to keep food on the table. Basically, it’s a job that appeals to those who would otherwise probably be outlaws themselves, real rough-and-tumble characters who just don’t fit into normal society. This description couldn’t possibly fit anybody more than the crew of the Bebop, a moderately sized vessel owned by a retired detective, that houses an ex-gangster, a femme fatale with a gambling problem, a psychotic child prodigy, oh, and also a dog. They may sound like a crew of rejects and shady characters, but with these cowboys on your tail, you might not even live to see prison.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop was produced by Studio Sunrise, a company that’s been churning out anime since the seventies, and is still just as prolific today, with some of their more recent hits including Code Geass, Love Live, and the entire Gundam catalog. Bebop was one of their last projects in the nineties, but there are a few other notable benchmarks it holds. First of all, Bebop was the last project that several people working for the company would make before they parted ways, and formed their own studio, the incredibly popular and well-respected Studio Bones. I’m assuming this split was an amicable one, because they were able to collaborate with their former parent company to make the Cowboy Bebop movie only a few years later. So yeah, the legendary production company that began in the 2ooo’s and is able to brag about producing both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist, Soul Eater, Ouran High School host Club and Space Dandy, to name a few, and it’s greatest precursor was Bebop.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              And the other benchmark? Cowboy Bebop was one of the final anime to be animated using hand-drawn cells rather than digital drawings. You would think this would be an indication of lacking visual quality, as the last efforts of one style before another takes over are usually somewhat pathetic... Just look at disco... But Cowboy Bebop is a glaring exception to that rule. Not only is it one of the best looking anime of the nineties, it holds up today as one of the best looking anime of all time. Yeah, when compared to offerings from today’s market, Bebop definitely has a very retro feel to it, but since the series was originally designed to be retro, that just makes the aesthetic all the more timeless. The animation is unbelievably fluid, with action scenes that never have to break frames to look impressive, and space battles epic enough to warrant a comparison to early Star Wars. Even when the action does slow down, and the camera does linger on a shot, the artwork is beautiful enough... And the cinematography is smart enough... That you’ll never complain about what you’re seeing.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The character designs are diverse, but human enough that everyone you meet... Aside from perhaps Ed and a certain balloon-like villain... Looks like someone that could easily be translated into real life, at least in terms of anatomy and facial structure. Their outfits are set to color palettes and styles that match their personalities while still remaining pleasing to the eye, and the backgrounds throughout are highly detailed. Episodes that take place in a western background are bright and welcoming, despite being broken down, dirty and weathered with time. Episodes with a more noir feel will take place in a tighter and darker environment, more shadowy and dangerous. Outer space is portrayed as expansive and empty, even when it’s filled with stars and debris. The use of color saturation and shading easily sells the tone and genre of any episode, and if you’re watching the newly released blu-ray version of the series, all of the show’s beauty is cranked up to eleven. And it’s not just the art style that enhances Bebop’s visual quality.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I feel like the best way to describe the music in this series would be to inform you that the musical composer of the series, Yoko Kanno, was also the inspiration for the personality and mannerisms of the character Ed, so try to imagine the kind of musical score that a film noir space western would have if it came from a wild, free-spirited genius with no respect for convention. Translation, it’s spectacular, possibly one of the best anime scores in the history of the medium. The score leans heavily towards jazz and the blues, and while the instruments that Kanno’s band The Seatbelts has available are diverse, there’s an intense focus on trombones and saxophones, which in my opinion aren’t used enough in anime. It fits perfectly in Cowboy Bebop, as the aesthetic demands a funky sounding soundtrack, but the stuff they didn’t do themselves... And thus the music that breaks from the series style... Are just as good. There’s a Steve Conte song called “Call me call me,” in one of the last episodes, that actually makes me cry, both in and out of context.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The most famous musical number from this series is probably Green Bird by Gabriela Robin, which is actually a false name for Yoko Kanno herself, which beautifully accompanies what little glimpses at Spike’s backstory we’re actually allowed to see. A certain western sounding tune named Go Go Cactus Man is also noteworthy for heralding the appearance of a literal cowboy, and amusingly enough, Spike himself reacts to this tune when it’s played. Outside of the score, the sound design is also smartly used, with smaller unreleased musical pieces hyping up the tension and suspense of episodes like Toys in the Attic, but all of that pales in comparison to the show’s opening and ending themes. Both are iconic in their own right, with Tank serving as the funky, undeniably catchy pump-up for some space-faring adventures, and the closing theme The Real Folk Blues serving as the power anthem that feels just right as the send-off to each episode, whether it was funny, serious or downright tragic.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The English dub, as I’ve said before, has become something of a measuring stick, to which all other anime dubs must compare themselves to. That’s not to say I think it’s the best dub of all time... There are still three that I think have surpassed it... But there are plenty of fans and critics who will make that claim, and it’s completely understandable why. The dub was directed by Mary Elizabeth Mcglynn, one of the most respected names in the dubbing industry, and for good reason. She also played several small roles in the cast, including the mysterious Julia and one of the more memorable villains, environmental extremist Twinkle Maria Murdock. Her adaptive script is accurate and on-point, despite slight changes to appeal to a western audiences, and I have to point this out, there are very rare occurrences where an actor will slip up and fail to match the character’s lip flaps. This barely ever happens, however, so it’s forgivable enough.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In terms of acting, all four of the main characters have become the most iconic roles of their respective actors. Steve Blum has been considered a legend in the industry thanks to his turn as Spike Spiegel, a laid back and lethargic louse who cares for nothing other than his next paycheck, except for those rare moments that he’s made to care, either due to a resurgence of his past life or due to a fleeting chance at bringing some genuine good into the world. Beau Billingslea is a highly successful man in both his personal and professional lives, and he’s also one of the only well-known black voice actors in the anime dubbing industry, thanks in no small part to his performance of Jet Black, a former detective and the cool, mature voice of reason of the Bebop crew. Wendee Lee is a bit of a hit-or-miss actor for me, as the quality of her work seems to fluctuate from project to project, but she’s at her absolute best as Faye Valentine, a character who can be confident and duplicitous one minute but then vulnerable and emotionally raw the next.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Then you have Melissa Fahn, who somehow managed to bring more insanity to the character of Ed than even the original seiyuu Aoi Tada. Her crazy ramblings also include random tangents in Japanese, which she fires off smoothly. Together, the four of them form a bizarre sort of chemistry that never quite feels like a proper family unit... They feel more like coworkers, tolerating each other and accepting each others’ eccentricities as they strive towards a common goal. That common goal, mind you, is the money to survive, something essential and vital, but also entirely impersonal. There’s no bonding between these characters, no intricate relationships, no changing each other’s paths and arcs... The characters let their guards down and show vulnerabilities, but almost never around each other, and the English cast is just as good at portraying this as the Japanese cast. Add to this the hilarious contributions by James Penrod as the raucous Cowboy Andy and Lia Sargent and Paul St. Pete as the Big Shot TV hosts Punch and Judy, I do highly recommend this dub over it’s original sub.

              I’ve always said, when defining what is and isn’t anime, that there really isn’t any set of qualities that can be taken into account consistently. No matter what rule you try to follow, there will always be outrageous exceptions made. The only philosophy that really makes sense is “Anime is made in Japan.” But for the people who actually try to draw a dividing line between anime and cartoons, there are a few arguments I keep hearing about. The first is that there’s an anime style. Big heads, giant tumorous eyes, small noses, exaggerated expressions... And another popular one is that anime is non-episodic, and tells a continuous story through plot progression and cohesive arcs. People will use these arguments as an excuse to call shows like Avatar and RWBY anime, and if you bring up shows like Shin-chan and Panty and Stocking, they’ll argue that those aren’t real anime, and were designed to be more like cartoons.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              But then you bring up Cowboy Bebop, a show that doesn’t waste it’s time with stereotypical anime expressions, doesn’t follow any alleged anime style, and for the most part, is episodic and full of filler. It’s heavily adult in it’s presentation, despite the fact that it doesn’t contain any gratuitous content... No giant boobs, no multi-episode fight scenes, no nudity or fanservice outside of a transexual dude and Faye occasionally sunbathing... No beach scenes, no hot springs episodes... Cowboy Bebop isn’t like any other anime, even the ones that have tried to copy it in the 20 years since it’s release. The idea of there being an anime style is quite frankly bullshit, as that’s a seriously reductive viewpoint on the medium, but aren’t the best anime the ones with engaging stories and involved plots? This isn’t even close to the case with Cowboy Bebop, a show that did horribly during it’s initial release in Japan, so why is it considered one of the best anime of all time? Why is it still a mainstay on American TV over a decade later?
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Well, there’s actually some backstory on that. When Bebop was initially released, the studio that played it got skittish about how adult it’s content was, and wound up airing it out of order, with several episodes left out entirely. This didn’t exactly build confidence with the audience, who weren’t even allowed to see the two best episodes, Ballad of Fallen Angels and Sympathy for the Devil. Keep in mind, this occurred in a country where that piece of shit Shadow Star was able to air on a Children’s Network. It was later run in it’s entirety on a less popular network named WOWOW, but the trouble it’s first network gave it provided a special kind of challenge for the series when it came to picking up steam. Heh, kinda reminds me of another series I know that got a lot of shit from it’s network, and was aired out of nowhere and treated unfairly by people who didn’t know how to handle it... In fact, you know what? Back up a bit. This show has a lot more in common with Firefly than just it’s initial problems, and I think I can use the comparison to explain why both shows are so immensely popular despite having a short run and a disastrous debut.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              There are plenty of similarities between Cowboy Bebop and Firefly, and considering the few things that the latter stole DIRECTLY from Outlaw Star, it wasn’t very likely a coincidence. Both shows feature an old, beaten down spaceship that acts as a surrogate home for a crew of misfits, surviving day to day on whatever jobs they can take in order to keep food on the table and fuel in the tank. The focus is on character more than plot, and most of the cast has extensive backstories that translate to other lives they’ve left behind, but are still haunted by. In both shows, Earth got used up, and humanity colonized the solar system, with no real aliens out there, and the territory is populated with an anachronistic array of settlements that the crew travels to and does business with. Firefly wound up being popular to this day for the same reason that Cowboy Bebop didn’t get popular until it reached the states... Because it’s a story that was designed to appeal to an American audience.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Japanese society has always been deeply rooted in tradition and conformity. It’s true that a lot of it’s art has made valiant efforts to challenge the norm, from Kill La Kill’s blatant attack on said values, and Ikuhara’s work taking every opportunity to question the patriarchy, but for an anime to be about individuals who don’t fit into society making a life for themselves without any attachments outside of their own personal interests, with no real beliefs or values outside of their need to survive, and for this to come out way back in 1997, I find it more surprising that the series EVENTUALLY became big over there. But more to the point, Cowboy Bebop was, perhaps inadvertently, designed to be successful in America, so by ripping it off, Firefly became so popular that over fifteen years later, it has it’s own line of Lootcrate merch. And yet, despite the many similarities, Cowboy Bebop is still superior to Firefly in every conceivable way, and it’s able to be so without having to try nearly as hard as Firefly did.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              First off, as much as I love it, Firefly was never that great at drama. Yeah there was danger, and characters would die, but actual emotional conflict? It would pop up in small doses, but never in any engaging way. It also, like MANY series both here and in Japan, used dangling plot threads to keep you watching. There were mysteries to be solved, romantic interests to be resolved, conspiracies to unravel... When shows do this, it can be great, but it still feels like there’s a carrot dangling in front of your face, daring you to run towards it. It goes perhaps without saying that Cowboy Bebop had none of these issues. It never needs to try to grab your attention... You don’t need to worry about what’s going to happen later on in the story, because everything that’s happening is perfectly interesting on it’s own. You don’t just want to see the characters prevail, and overcome each obstacle, preserving the status quo, you want to see them overcome themselves and break the stasis they’ve surrounded themselves with in order to find whatever it is they’ve been missing.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is about four outcasts with nowhere to go, nowhere to call home, and pasts that they can no longer return to. In a sense, they’ve given up anything they once held dear in order to just survive day to day, putting their loved ones, morals and dreams aside because even if there is something for them to go back to, which isn’t always the case, doing so would carry unimaginable consequences, so you wind up having no idea whether you want them to find closure or just move forward. Anybody who’s held a job in order to pay the bills can immediately relate to this, and yet the fact that the crew of the Bebop have taken on even more uncertainty and risk by working a job that lets them hold onto a little bit of freedom by being their own bosses still makes them so easy to idolize. You get episodes of backstory for the entire main cast save for Ed, and these episodes are by far the best of the bunch because of everything they teach us about their past lives and how they wound up in this life, and then you’ll get the one-off episodes that are somehow just as awesome on their own, with so many imaginative and complex ideas that fit perfectly into the Bebop universe. All of these episodes, in their own way, explore the dichotomy of life, death, and the purpose that each serves.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop was originally available from Bandai, both in individual cases and in a much more attractive Remix collection set, which was my copy of the series for years until Funimation bought the rights, and released it on Gorram Blu-Ray. I don’t care how much your physical copies of this series mean to you, you need to buy it on Blu-Ray. It’s a lot cheaper than the Amazon Exclusive version, although that one DOES come with a whole slew of bonus goodies. The movie, Knocking on Heaven’s door, is also available pretty cheap at most locations, and it’s also really great. The manga adaptations are also easily available stateside, although you’re best bet is to look online.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is not just an example of how anime can break it’s own rules and still be great, nor is it just an example of how good an anime from the nineties could look. It is also, and perhaps most importantly, an example of how a character driven story doesn’t need to have a plot, especially if it’s written in such a way that the characters ARE the plot. They’re all so likeable and so interesting that there are literally no boring moments throughout the series, because everything that happens involves them or is related to them in some way. I’ve heard some people complain about the crew not landing very many bounties, but I honestly think that’s the whole point. The ship is symbolic of the status quo that so many other shows rely on. As long as they stay there, sheltered from their old lives, they can never succeed, nor can they fail. They can never really live, nor can they die. They can only tread water, surviving. That might sound comfortable for some, but for Spike Spiegel, and ultimately for the philosophy of the series, it’s better to die young than to survive without living. This work, which has become a genre unto itself, is known as Cowboy Bebop, and I give it a 10/10.

            Cowboy Bebop is set in the future well intergalactic travel is normal and everyone has their own spaceship. Spike Spiegel and his partner Jet Black are two bounty hunters and owners of the spaceship Bebop. Later joined by Faye Valentine, Ed and Ein, the group fly around in space, taking on bounties to survive. Each bounty they take is more trouble than they are worth but they take them with good hearts and a good sense of humor. You learn more and more about each character as the series rolls on a grow strongly attached to each of them by the end.
            <br>
             <br/>
             The series is very
             <span id="review230717" style="display: none;">
              episodic in a way that each episode has no real relation to each other, except the double part episodes. There isn't really a story to be told aside from the group hunting bounties and Spike dealing with his past. That is the reason it took me so long to watch this series. Although I enjoyed watching the characters and their adventures, I found it rather hard to start the next episode. There wasn't exactly a draw that hooked me into watching it. That, however was my only problem with the series. Aside from that, I thought it was absolutely fantastic.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The characters are absolutely phenomenal. Many episodes explain more about each characters past and makes you grow attached to each other them. I can't say there was a character that I disliked from this series as they were all so different and so interesting to watch. My personal favorite was Faye. I don't want to give anything away, but she has a couple rather interesting episodes that bring tears to my eyes. Each character has somewhat of a sad past, each of them having someone they loved and lost and rediscovering them in different ways.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I watched it dubbed because I heard that the dub was amazing and many say even better. I thought it was great, no complaints at all. It's not in a setting where Japanese culture matters, I suppose. The music is jazzy and the intro will be stuck in my head for the rest of my life. I don't care too much for art from the 90's but for an anime from 1998, I thought it looked amazing. One thing I do want to point out though, was that everyone in the anime appeared human. I don't know exactly how much of space they explored or how many planets they go to, but everyone was human. It's not a complaint or anything, just pointing that out.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Aside from the patchy story, I thought Cowboy Bebop was an amazing anime. It was really entertaining, the action is violent, the characters are lovable, the humor is rich, pretty much everything you could ask for.

            I,ve been hearing a lot about how Cowboy Bebop is so unoriginal and that there are way more better anime out there but they are wrong, there is nothing else to it they are just plain wrong and here's why.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Story 9/10 this part I can understand a little bit because the show has an episodic manner and then it get's into a story at the end and some people say that the rest of the show was a waste but if the show was about the characters trying to get to the end the show would have been much worse everyone says that all the
             <span id="review264554" style="display: none;">
              episodes are the same but when I rewatched it I realised that none of the episodes were the same,there was this one user who said that all the episodes were like an example that he gave and he perfectely described 1 episode, none of the other episodes were like that.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              10/10 The art is also one of the most outstanding things about the show, all of it was so smooth and interesting and everything was slightly shaded to compliment the tone of the show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound 10/10 The sound and the music are beyond perfect for the show because the hole show is in the future but the nice jazzy guitars and harmonicas make the show set like a western and they go perfect with the show. Not to mention the opening is kick ass.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters 10/10 A lot of people say that the characters are cliche and boring but they,re all good, Everyone says that Spike is your average cool guy but why is that bad? You litterally just insulted someone by saying that they,re cool and Spike is more than just cool he is skilled at martiwl arts and he has many funny and cool one liners to make his character loveable. Jet is good but people say that he doesn't have character devellopment but Cowboy Bebop is not about character devellopment, it,s about peopke who have been through character devellopment and they are just living out their lives.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoyment 10/10 The show has many interesting stories anda ridiculous amount of amazing scenes the action is cool the one liners are epice and/or funny and the show never lets you down on any episode.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall 10/10 Cowboy Bebop is the best anime of all time and if you don't think so then you have shit taste.

            Going into this series, I was expecting a lot. I was consistently hearing that this was one of the all time greatest animes. I also kept hearing how great its English Dub is, so of course I watched it dubbed. It 's also the first series I've watched to follow a episodic narrative design, where each episode was treated like a miniature movie. This anime was directed by Shinichiro Watanabe who would also later direct other highly praised shows such as Samurai Champloo and Space Dandy. So after finally getting to watch this legendary series here's what I thought of it.
            <br>
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Story:9/10
             <br/>
             Brilliantly written and very sophisticated.
             <span id="review247629" style="display: none;">
              The series mainly revolves around the main characters' past and it explores that in such a beautiful way. Due to it's narrative design we are given so many memorable episodes with my personal fav being episode 20, "Pierrot Le Fou,' Each episode contains a different story approach and it gives us different genres. For example there are episodes where we would get 80's action, detective drama, sci fi horror, psychological thrillers, and Chinese martial arts. This gives the series a wide range of variety and mixed tones that helps satisfy many viewers with their own unique tastes and preferences. It's necessary to keep in mind that Watanabe was heavily influenced by American cinema as this has been stated by many of his interviews. And although it doesn't have a strong reliance on action, this series had great and memorable action in particular the shootout scenes. This series also had one of the best conclusions ever, it ended in a bang. As for flaws it's not really a story driven series so there isn't much plot progression. For example the main plot between Spike and the main antagonist are only focused on for a handful of episodes. It also suffered a lil bit from exposition as there were a few things that weren't fully explained.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art:10/10
              <br/>
              This was the one area that impressed me the most. This series came out in the 1990s yet it looks better than most animes I've watched in the 2000s. The animation never lost consistency and it was fluid as water. The movie quality was great as like I said, each episode felt like a short movie. Visuals were great and very detailed and none of the character designs felt out of place. Every character here was drawn in a very realistic way. What's strange about the show is that at first glance it may seem rather bland or limited since it's not heavily action packed. However what the series excels in is not how much movement is going on but how high the quality of each scene has. For example a lot of characters are given specific gestures and postures that helps explain their feelings or personalities; whether it's Spike walking around with a relaxed slouch to potray his chill personality, Jet's more tense upright posture that shows off his maturity, Faye's curvy posing that supports her sexiness, and Ed's constant quirky movements that matches her eccentric character. The distinct body language was a way to help establish its characters and it did it in such an excellent and realistic way.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound:10/10
              <br/>
              This is where Cowboy Bebop stands out from most animes. For one it has SUPERB voice acting. It wasn't over the top at all and everyone's voice fit and Spike sounded so cool. The dub is so great that I honestly believe it to be superior to the Japanese version. And of course the soundtrack, one of the best any person can hear in ANYTHING. The opening song, ending song, to its beautiful jazz flowing in the background, the music perfectly matched the show's atmosphere. If I was blind and had only my ears, this anime will still heavily satisfy me.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Character:9/10
              <br/>
              The development here is incredible but what really stands out is that we really connect wit these characters like their actual people. And really love the relationships between the main characters cuz although they don't always get along their all they have and it leads to some emotional moments. The main antagonist here is great cuz although not overly powerful, the character plays a huge impact on the main character. Whenever these two were together you'll almost cry inside cuz their past is so deep.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Final Verdict
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              One word, masterpiece. Simply one of the greatest animated works you can ever find. Cowboy Bebop is just too important to the anime world and its one series that all of us needs to see. This series is all about style, and when it comes to style there's no better anime out there than this. With its beautiful animation, great music, and endearing characters, there's no doubt why Cowboy Bebop is considered to be the landmark title in Anime.
              <br/>

            "Once upon a time, in New York City in 1941... at this club open to all comers to play, night after night, at a club named "Minston's Play House" in Harlem, they play jazz sessions competing with each other. Young jazz men with a new sense are gathering. At last they created a new genre itself. They are sick and tired of the conventional fixed style jazz. They're eager to play jazz more freely as they wish then... in 2071 in the universe... The bounty hunters, who are gathering in the spaceship "BEBOP", will play freely without fear of risky things.

             dreams and films by breaking traditional styles. The work, which becomes a new genre itself, will be called... COWBOY BEBOP"
             <br>
              <br/>
              That quote is probably a valid review of the first 24 episodes of the anime.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is a set of parables, picking up and dropping off at whatever random points the main characters happen to stumble upon them, and in some cases, ending them. The beauty in Cowboy Bebop stands in the one story that we kinda sorta actually get to see. The story of Spike. I would argue that just about every other story told would be just as interesting as his if only we had the time to more fully develop the characters and plot. But Spike's story, that one we do get the pleasure of experiencing. The weight that we get to carry.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This anime is about a very specific aspect of the human experience: empathy. It forces us to empathize with a roster of characters and watch them struggle. Not at all to the extent that as something like Texhnolyze, but enough to make you ponder the reality of what you've just seen. Every character lives and dies by their own decisions, and you're tasked with burdening those decisions; to understand and accept them.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Other than that, it's simply an astonishingly good looking, good sounding, mostly episodic, perfect anime with tons of style points.

            For those who haven't caught any of the show or the hype, Cowboy Bebop initially involves just two guys, Spike and Jet, who are trying to make a living as interstellar bounty hunters. They travel from system to system trying to earn rewards for bringing in various and sundry criminals in their heap of a spaceship named the Bebop. As their journeys continue, we learn more about their pasts--Jet's life as a cop, and Spike's membership in a crime syndicate--while they meet up with others who become a part of their crew. Faye Valentine's a selfish but beautiful gal who occasionally works with the guys

             when not gambling or trying to understand the memories of her past that have gone missing. Ed's a she that looks like a he that can hack into any computer system, providing she doesn't giggle and goofytalk her way into oblivion. And Ein's a good-natured data dog with as much personality as his companions in just a simple woof. A ragtag bunch if we've ever seen one, the five nevertheless wind up capturing the imagination and hearts of their audience easily during their 26 episodes of adventures.
             <br>
              <br/>
              I have never seen an animated television series look so fantastic. Almost every episode of Bebop rivals theatrical animation, trouncing on OVAs that supposedly have better budgets. It looks amazing. The soundtrack by Yoko Kanno, a jazz fusion blend, is immediately catchy, but it has surprising depth, enough that the CD has become a regular companion. If you like animation at all, you'll have to see Bebop. And, frankly, it doesn't matter if you are a subtitle purist or a dub fan, because both versions are fantastic. I watch subs almost exclusively, and I got hooked on the dub. That just doesn't happen to me, but it did here. It's that good.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              But beyond that, the show has a style and colorfulness lacking in too many anime. True, some shows like Hellsing are drenched in style, but that's all they are. Cowboy Bebop is cool without ever having to rely on attitude alone to see it through. Although I tend to prefer shows with plotlines that build on each other, Bebop grows our affection for the characters through mostly stand-alone episodes. There is back-story to be told, and it's told well, but rarely do shows without a strong story arch feel so natural. It shouldn't be as powerful as it is, but it's a testament to good storytelling.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Then there's that wonderful history and the drastic ending (which I won't spoil here, though I'll discuss it below under the main review). I'm reminded when watching Cowboy Bebop of the tagline from the beautifully haunting film Magnolia: "We may be through with the past, but the past isn't through with us." Bebop is effective because each character has such a rich history before the stories here even begin that they are fully realized in every way. Sadly, in most anime, characters exist only to fulfill plot purposes, rather than existing as entities unto themselves. In fact, Bebop works because we go through the entire show, right up to its conclusion, without knowing everything there is to know about these folks. They are motivated by issues that the writers developed that we don't even fully understand. That lends a reality to the characters that makes them far more enjoyable than we expect. When their pasts catch up with them, we care.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This leads us to the controversial part...the last few episodes that wrap everything up. The events of those episodes are cataclysmic, to say the least. For American audiences, they can mar the experience, even. (As one friend said to me, "Now that I've watched the whole thing, the last couple episodes make me sad, in a way, that I did.") But they are very Japanese, encapsulating the ambiguity and realism that set the very best anime apart. I believe that they make the show even more authentic and worthy. At the same time, the only thing that keeps me from giving the show an A+ is that the ending doesn't have the emotional impact it should because we just don't know quite enough back-story yet for it to work. We are left with too many questions. Again, I attribute it to the fact that Japanese stories are rife with ambiguity. But this one could have stood just a little bit less.

              That being said, Cowboy Bebop is easily in my list of "best anime ever". If you like anime, you should see it. Period. Normally, I use my final paragraph to sum it all up, but that says it all. You should see it.

             Overall, very enjoyable show. I’d definitely recommend it to people that haven’t watched it before. I won’t go so far as to say it was a masterpiece; Overall , it was very good with some great moments/aspects sprinkled in to make it worth the watch.

             I felt like I grew attached the the crew characters stories and loved their interactions with each other. Its difficult to describe more, other than that (at least in the dub version I watched) their interactions with each other flow extremely well every scene they're in. I
             <span id="review211002" style="display: none;">
              liked the fact that Spike meets so many different kinds of people throughout the anime.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I think this anime’s best points were its variety in terms of episodes, and also its excellent atmospheres and ESPECIALLY the great musical scores and how they were incorporated with specific animated sequences. The sheer amount of varied characters, personality wise and appearance wise, was especially cool.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The “main" story-line was only a few episodes, the story there was pretty interesting and fun to watch but honestly nothing revolutionary. Same with the episodes that focused on the background of the crew members. The other mini stories presented were usually pretty fun and/or quite interesting to watch but sometimes weren’t that enticing.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              My favorite episode was probably Ballad of Fallen Angels, I liked it more than Jupiter Jazz 1 and 2, and I think it just ever so slightly edges out The Real Folk Blues 1 and 2. Other than that I really like the VCR tape episode for its unexpected very well executed ending minutes.

              I liked the fact that this show had silly episodes where you could just kick back and enjoy the antics that the crew got themselves into, and at the same time having those serious episodes sprinkled in that really hit home in a good way. Even in some of the silly episodes it was really cool to see some things that have deeper meaning, or you find elements in them that hit you in the feels.

              The most glaring negative aspect of this anime that some of the episodes seemed to be rather boring to me. But these were generally few and far between. Well that and what I mentioned before, the main plot isn't super exciting. I'll also say that the main character's backgrounds are really not explored to a very satisfying level, its not that the characters don't feel fleshed out in the show, it's just that I would have really appreciated more in depth back story about all of them to make me care about them more.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Ultimately , Cowboy Bebop is a damn good, solidly enjoyable, and unique experience that I think every anime fan really should have on their watched list.

             What makes an anime unforgettable? Characters, to be short and thick. Cowboy Bebop is one of the best animations of all time because, in its 26 episodes of 20 minutes each, it manages to reach the soul of the spectator in edges that the spectator himself was unaware of being possible to be reached, even more by a work designed. Shinichiro's anime has style - a lot of jazz! -, humor and drama pervaded by quality and especially of a tone of its own, standing out on any list of best anime and making it unique.
             <br/>
             In this sense, the design owes much
             <span id="review255014" style="display: none;">
              to its beautiful technical aspects. The animation of the action scenes, especially in Spike's fight scenes and in space duels, is breathtaking, especially given the year of the 1998 anime release. It goes so far as to outdo many (!) Current animations. Example of this soon sees in the first episode, where we know the style of the hairy and lazy Spike - an unforgettable image, although banal. Combining such quality with creativity in architecting an incredible range of scenarios, ranging from the most megalomaniac to the intimate.

            Overview:
            <br>
             As one of the most famous anime of the 1990's, "Cowboy Bebop" is a show that needs no introduction. With that in mind, there is almost no need to write this review other than to state my own personal opinion. With its smooth, detailed animation, highly unique music style, awesome action scenes, flawless voice acting and quirky yet lovable characters, "Cowboy Bebop" is a brilliant crime fiction/space western series that deservedly became an instant classic.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Story &amp; World (8.5/10):
             <br/>
             The series takes place in the year 2071, roughly sixty years after an accident with a hyperspace gateway made the Earth uninhabitable. Because of this incident, humanity has
             <span id="review217627" style="display: none;">
              colonized most of the rocky planets and moons of the Solar System. Amid a rising crime rate, the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) set up a legalized contract system, in which registered bounty hunters (also referred to as "Cowboys") chase criminals and bring them in alive in return for a reward. The crew of the titular spaceship Bebop are a group of such bounty hunters. Originally, the crew consists only of our main character, Spike Spiegel and his partner Jet Black, but with the first nine episodes, three new members join the crew. The series has a largely episodic nature that follows this group of misfits hunting down criminals while also covering their day-to-day lives.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              One thing you'll notice is that the crew hardly ever get the bounties, often screwing things up by ultimately killing the person or having something else happen. Unfortunately, as you can guess, this can get a bit repetitive, as you begin to expect that they'll end up risking their lives and get absolutely nothing for their trouble. Now and again, however, the show does see them capturing bounties alive, just to show that they're actually good at what they do. And when I say 'a bit repetitive', I mean 'a bit', as the episodes have a wide variety of genres, including film noir, gothic horror, creature-feature, black comedy, screwball comedy, spy action, tragedy, action, philosophy, science, spirituality, buddy-buddy stories, parody and everything in between. One episode might be extremely funny while the next could be highly bleak or unsettling.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Largely, however, the show doesn't really have a story. While there is two story arcs, they only really come in when needed and often go several episodes without being touched upon. I felt that Spike's arc, which focuses on his past as a criminal, was quite underdeveloped as a lot of things aren't really made clear. Thankfully, I can say that the ending of the series as a whole is absolutely fantastic.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art &amp; Animation (9/10):
              <br/>
              "Cowboy Bebop"'s animation is extremely smooth. While there are better-looking anime out there, the fights are brilliantly choreographed and, for a hand-drawn series, the characters and environments are all incredibly detailed, with everyone and everything having a distinct appearance. All of this creates a fantastic-looking anime that still holds up even to this day. Considering the show first aired in the late 90s, that is quite an accomplishment.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound &amp; Dialogue (10/10):
              <br/>
              My God, the music is absolutely fantastic! It is a very unique style that really fits the tone of the series. I cannot think of a single other anime that uses jazz music, and it's used to full effect here. There is only one opening and one ending theme ('Tank!' and 'The Real Folk Blues', respectively) but they are both two of the best themes for an anime I have ever seen. The voice acting is just as good, with the English dub being known for one-upping the Japanese original. I especially like Steven Blum and Wendee Lee's performances as Spike and Faye, respectively. The former has a really cool voice which really fits Spike's laid-back personality and the latter pulls off Faye's feminine charming perfectly. The script is great as well, largely thanks to Spike's brilliant snarky quips.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters (9/10):
              <br/>
              The Bebop crew can be summed up as follows- the grumpy, sarcastic guy (Spike), the femme fatale (Faye), the wise mentor (Jet), the dog (Ein) and the kid (Ed, who is a girl, btw). However, there is far, far more to them than just that. Spike is a former criminal haunted by the lost of a loved one, Faye is an amnesiac con artist, Jet is a former cop with a robot arm and acts as Spike's foil, Ein is a lab experiment to create a very intelligent dog and Ed is an expert hacker with a... very odd thought pattern.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              All of the Bebop crew have their moments in the sun, with various episodes focusing on a specific member. Spike's past catches up to him and he forced to face off against his former best friend-turned-enemy Vicious (more on him later), Faye attempts to recover her lost memory and Jet is forced to deal with various issues from his past as a cop. Ed and Ein don't get as much focus as the core trio, and the episodes that focus on them tend to be very comical.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              All of the Bebop crew are lovable in their own ways, but Spike and Faye are by far the most developed. Ed and Ein remain pretty much the same throughout the entire series and while Jet goes through several instances of cleaning up his own past, it doesn't really affect his outlook and lifestyle, with him still being the same gruff but gentle giant. Spike and Faye, on the other hand, are the focus of the major story arcs of the series, with Spike looking for his lost love and settling his score with Vicious and Faye attempting to recover her memory and find her place in the universe. While they remain rather grumpy and unpleasant even to the end, they do definitely care for each other and their shipmates. Plus, they (along with Jet) can more than hold their own in a fight.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This brings us to the main villain, Vicious, a ruthless crime lord who most certainly lives up to his name, as he is notorious for betraying anybody even remotely close to him. He also has legendary skill with a katana, to the point that he manages to make a sword vs. gun fight between him and Spike seem fair, albeit with a bit of cheating on his part. He appears in a total of five episodes and is the only recurring antagonist in the series. That said, some other villains do leave lasting impression even though they only appear in one episode. That is very difficult to do.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoyment (9.5/10):
              <br/>
              Due to the variety in the episodes, you are unlikely to ever be bored while watching "Cowboy Bebop". Even if you aren't a big fan of anime, you can still really enjoy this series due to it being largely Western-styled. Some of the episodes, however, especially the last four, are very unsettling and may put off some people. Others, on the other hand, are incredibly funny, so essentially there's something here for everyone.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall:
              <br/>
              The fact that "Cowboy Bebop" is just as popular today as it was when it first aired nearly twenty years ago easily cements its status as a timeless classic, and, having watched it myself, I can easily see why. Fluid animation, awesome music and memorable characters make this one of my favourite anime thus far. If, by any chance, you haven't watched this series, I would recommend you do so as soon as possible.

            As a child, Cowboy Bebop was an animation that "I didn't get"; it was focusing on a much bigger picture that wasn't tied to explosions and intense action. Now as an adult and rewatching the series. I am convinced that it is one of the greatest animation/shows ever made. There is a mastercraft work of how this show delivers its ideas and characters that we often overlook or take for granted today. The main character Spike Speigel is no superhero or beefed up multi-colored character, but rather a cocky, lazy and sometimes efficient bounty hunter. The brilliance in this setup however is that Spike feels
            <span id="review256878" style="display: none;">
             more human and relates more to me than any character in animation I have yet to see. His past and his attitude all reflect a sort of Han Solo anti hero style that makes him compelling to watch. Of course Ein, Edward, Valentine and Jet are also great characters to watch too as their backstories give just enough to wet the palate of your imagination and leaves them open ended for you to decide for yourself what their lives are like.
             <br>
              <br/>
              In a world where anime can take to monstrous heights and commitment where watching hundreds of episodes can be a huge deterrent for newcomers, Cowboy Bebop only comprises of a single season and carries far more impact and power than any I had watch even now. This is not to overshadow other shows that have their own moments, but to see something so short get so much right is why some, myself included, consider it a masterpiece. The opening is iconic and really is one of the best intros to any show (including non-anime) that you could ever have, with jazz and blues mixed and with a touch of this Wild Western grit that really hooks you right in.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Of course there are always flaws to every show and this one is no exception. While the artwork and design is still strong overall, there are some animations that have seen age and can be a bit silly despite a possible serious tone. Not every episode has the same quality (which all still rank above well done anyways) given so it's a matter of looking far more into the themes and concepts to take more from it. Aside from some nitpicks, the show still remains a staple to animation done at it's peak. 10/10s are often misunderstood by people as "perfect" but nothing truly is; it's just a representation of how a craft is fine tuned to deliver compelling pieces of art and characters that we take away from. A gigantic explosion will always be trumped by a finger gun by a dying man as he shows his last cocky attitude to the viewer.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is outstanding in it's entirety. Nothing is weak or dull for a single episode. The characters and their backgrounds are all wonderfully interesting and have a huge sense of relativity to ourselves. We often see anime show teens that fight for their emerging adulthoods and being as changed people. Cowboy Bebop shows adults that don't change and the struggles of living in such a world that it makes it even far better. Watch this animation, there is a sadness and yet engrossing tale to be told that is outstanding in every sense of the word.

            Where to start on this one?  Putting aside all jokes and the renown the show has Cowboy Bebop is not an easy reviewed title.
            <br>
             <br/>
             If you've been a fan of anime for a while there's a good chance you already know what I am about to say.  Cowboy Bebop is great, and if you have not tried it yet I'd recommend at least going through it once.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             STORY and THEMES
             <br/>
             The story to Cowboy Bebop is rather straight forward at first glance.  You simply follow the lives, of at the start two bounty hunters.  But eventually what seems like a
             <span id="review211753" style="display: none;">
              straight forward story will eventually unwind into a more complex commentary on many common and uncommon themes, while never abusing the main story.  Whether its the display and contemplation of immortality in Episode 6, or the themes of friendship and betrayal in the 2 Episodes of Jupiter Jazz, you can tell that there is more than just a simple love/revenge story.  You can get something out of every episode and I think that helps the show stand out as a whole.  With its episodic formula of following different stories in each new episode (Discounting Jupiter Jazz, and The Real Folk Blues) many may be turned off.  But the fact that they use these stories to teach something or add to the experience, makes the system  not only work, but become ideal for the show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              SETTING/SOUND/ART
              <br/>
              The setting is honestly one of the best I've ever come across in an anime.  The pseudoscience and spaceship designs make any astrophysics nerds (Such as myself) already love the show right off the bat.  The perfect blend of early 20th century wild west themes and a sci-fi setting help set the show apart from any other.   The sound is amazing, it has one of the best sound tracks I've ever heard.  I think this is most prominent in the last few episodes especially the song jazz rock song "Real Folk Blues".  The art is godly.  While being an older anime some characters may look off or slightly disproportionate the scenic scenes are drawn with such detail its awe inspiring.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              CHARACTERS
              <br/>
              The character development in this show is amazing.  Without giving too much away it is obvious you can see characters develop and start caring for one another.  And when a character is in peril you feel like there's something at risk.  Combine all this with good comedy from each character and you get a lovely cast of characters that becomes very likable later in the show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              TD;LR  If you haven't already give this one a watch, you should.   I promise it won't disappoint.  Everyone has their own taste, and Bebop knows this it has something for everyone in the show, and I personally love the show.  I watched it subbed, but the dubbed is adequate.  Just give it a watch, it won't disappoint
              <br/>

             "Masterpiece" is a word that people like to throw around when talking about Cowboy Bebop. As you can see with my rating I don't really agree with that statement when describing this show. While it is magnificent in it's art/animation and GODLY soundtrack my overall enjoyment suffers because of the episodic nature of the show. I don't really like episodic type show as it doesn't really gives me any urgency or drive to keep going to the next episode. I do like Mushishi  but difference being that show doesn't really
             <span id="review309393" style="display: none;">
              have an ultimate goal or main plot but Cowboy Bebop does.
              <br/>
              There is also the characters. They are very good characters but a little more episodes would have been great to give more focus on what they think in their heads since all them have some sorts of secrets. My main complain is with one character that is the main villain. He was extremely under-developed even when they were showing him as the ultimate bad guy.
              <br/>

              That's all Thanks for reading.

            People who have seen my previous reviews will most likely understand the style of Anime that I particularly enjoy.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop is not an Anime that I enjoy but this doesn't mean that its a bad Anime and in fact, I believe it to be an exceptionally crafted experience and a beautiful episodic piece of art.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop throws you into the deep end immediately and doesn't take much time explaining to you how things work in this world and it completely expects you to figure out how it works for yourself while providing an upfront (but not that obvious) paper trail for you to follow as
             <span id="review309246" style="display: none;">
              it slowly begins expanding and winding you in deeper with seemingly disconnected stories.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The animation at times can come across as a bit stilted and blocky but when the series decides to open up you'll find that there is also a lot of craft that has been put into it that can make you completely forget about other minor details that may appear throughout.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Dealing with themes of loneliness, the past, transhumanism and sorrow Cowboy Bebop tells a rather mature story through stylistic influences ranging from noir, old westerns and martial arts movies.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The soundtrack consists of beautifully blended yet diverse soundscapes with musical influences ranging from blues, jazz, funk and sometimes a hint of country.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I might not enjoy Cowboy Bebop and a large part of that may stem from the fact that I might not just 'get it' but I don't believe that I don't need to 'get' something in order to appreciate it for what it is.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I feel as though I'm missing out on appreciating this anime to its fullest but on the other hand I can confidently give this anime a 9/10 and say that if you're a fan of westerns, noirs, martial arts, cult classic films or any of the music genres I've mentioned before then you'll certainly find something in Cowboy Bebop that you can enjoy.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              And on a final note, I just want to say that without Cowboy Bebop I might never have gotten into Jazz so for this I'm forever thankful.

            An absolute masterpiece of an anime!
            <br>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop is a gorgeous slice of life anime filled with interesting characters, stunning visuals and incredible background scores. With fluid fight sequences and homage to different genres and cultures, each episode is unique in itself and bursting with art and life.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             This is an anthology series at it's finest and people complaining about a lack of continuity or motive to the series need to read up on the meaning of an "Anthology format" and perhaps veer away from it altogether.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop was, is and will always be a timeless classic, and it has arguably, one of the best,
             <span id="review309121" style="display: none;">
              most fulfilling endings to a story in anime history.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              See you Space Cowboy.....

             As a very casual anime watcher, this was one of the first series I watched besides the mainstream shounen animes. I was afraid to watch it because of how old it was, but the animation was amazing in my eyes. It gave me a retro, but smooth and crisp feel, the animation aged very finely over the decades. Now, the sound stepped up the anime, with simple vibes yet free-flowing and complimented each scene, which is what the anime was built around. And on to the characters. They seem simple at first, but are more complex as we learn more about the characters, especially Spike
             <span id="review306938" style="display: none;">
              Speigel. What really confuses me about him is that he wouldn't seem like the guy to be so thrown over by a girl, or by anything. I was still left with so much confusion about the characters like the backgrounds between Spike and Viscous. The anime provided enough information to fill in most of the rest, but I was still left with many questions after the anime ended. I really enjoyed this anime as the story is simple yet the characters are not, it uses amazing music to add to the already amazing scenes and clean art, this is why it deserves a 9. Now, remember, I'm not the most experienced watcher, but I loved Cowboy Bebop because of how simple it was.

            "An anime that was delivered to the bebop with no return address. Because we wanted to view the tape, things took a turn for the unexpected. Well actually it doesn't go anywhere, at first glance the story is pointless, the action is on a small scale and the ending is forced but then again what conclusions will you draw from it?" - Jet Black
            <br>
             <br/>
             Next episode: I don't give a shit because there is nothing to look forward to in this anime, the story I kid you not actually made me fall asleep. The characters were so undeveloped I didn't cry when any of them died,
             <span id="review303048" style="display: none;">
              Viscious is also just a one-dimensional villain who is bad for the sake of being bad.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The fact that I even got through this entire anime is a miracle, I usually get swayed by public opinion alot, like for example if an anime gets really high ratings and I watch it, I would give it a rating higher than I thought it was. But Cowboy Bebop was such a let down, I just can't lie about my feelings. So yes, it is boring and it is overrated.

            Let's start off with a false dichotomy, the show in question is often criticized for its preference of style over substance, a complaint that demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of art and is as insubstantial as it is hypocritical. On the other hand Bebop is praised endlessly for its technical aspects relating to presentation (animation, sfx, voice acting, etc), often coupled with some sort of attribution of a more profound message about these sort of vague, vacuous, mostly unreal emotions and hang-ups; a general lack of will to "move on" or an inability to "be an adult", to "grow up", and other assorted
            <span id="review279927" style="display: none;">
             unimportant cliches to be found among all the stylish action and dialogue.
             <br>
              <br/>
              Let it be said that Cowboy Bebop is not necessarily particularly original, but it never strikes you as trying to be. Essentially, the reason you should watch this, if you have any interest, is that it's cool, it excites the eyes and ears, and is not without its own flavor of emotional engagement. Bebop has prodigiously choreographed furious flights of fists and feet, charmingly cheesy dialogue, if you've got the right disposition for it, an entertaining, resonating cast that despite the pulp-like world they inhabit, feel realistic and believable, arguably more references and homages than it ought to, and a mostly pleasing soundtrack that at its best properly surprises when it matters to back it all up.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Despite whatever previous intentions one may be unaware of, Cowboy Bebop isn't really about anything other than being around for the ride these characters are on, a dramatic spectacle of a trip to be sure. By the end of it you're left with a strong feeling of shared experience, which should be expected of any character driven piece of fiction, but Bebop excels at this, which is probably why it stuck with so many people for as long as it did.

            Space cowboys be like. Before watching this I had gotten the "bebop hype" as I'd like to call it. I had asked some friends before hand of what they thought about it and should I watch it. I wasn't too much ready for this anime, expecting  some form of complex plot or something of the sort. But I was wrong. Instead, I just got prices of the crazy life of Spike and Jet. The episodes don't have any real chronological order, except for the first few episodes, and that what I like about it. The fights scenes paired with the art style, are what
            <span id="review298955" style="display: none;">
             really sparked my interest though. Don't even get me started on the fight scenes. Although they are quite rare in the anime, they show real combat that involves the environment quite a lot. I also enjoyed watching the side main characters get involved with Spike and Jet's adventures as well. I'd highly recommend this anime for perhaps new comers and for people who just wanna watch something not too mind boggling.

            If I had to describe it in one word: Cool.
            <br>
             <br>
              It's absolutely just one of the coolest anime's you'll ever watch. The settings, the characters, the music, the effects, it's all just so well done. I mean I don't even like jazz, but this got me to be like "Wow, jazz is actually pretty awesome!" Don't let that sentence fool you either, the soundtrack is a mix of genres, not just jazz.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              There are so many things going on, but they are woven together beautifully. If I had to pick a favorite episode, it'd probably be Hard Luck Woman. Edward is my favorite character, and I
              <span id="review298643" style="display: none;">
               really like Faye as well, so I love how the episode ties up some of those loose ends.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Please if you've never seen this anime, please check it out!
