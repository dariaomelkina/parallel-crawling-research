            Well, yeah, Cowboy Bepop is kind of OK anime, its not like those anime where  you spend a lot of time,
            <br>
             <br/>
             I mean you can watch better Anime then this, Yu Yu Hakusho, Inuyasha are better then Cowboy Bepop,
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Well that's what i felt when watching Cowboy Bepop,
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Its nothing legendary or anything, i think people like it because it resembles more of the Star Wars/ American thing,
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The Characters are kind of Ok,
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Presentation was mediocre at best, its not as epic as other Anime like Yu Yu Hakusho, DragonballZ, Inuyasha, Mobile Suit Gundam and many other old anime have,
             <br/>
             <br/>
             It was nothing spectacular, it was Ok, that's it
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Even
             <span id="review305674" style="display: none;">
              Naruto is better then Cowboy Bepop
              <br/>
              <br/>
              just wanted to let the people know why to stay away from Cowboy Bepop

            This is the quintessential anime. Yes, you heard it. The perfection in every way.
            <br>
             A one time in a lifespan journey. A diamond in the anime world. A chest full of gold buried in a very deep hole that everyone forgot about. This is Cowboy Bebop.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             By the year of 2014, many people would rather watch One Piece or SAO or whatever they watch thats new, instead of watching Cowboy Bebop since its outdated to say the least. It doesn't have a sharp animation and the drawing is no way near what it is today. Well, if you think like this, then fuck you. You don't deserve
             <span id="review154045" style="display: none;">
              to experience what this masterpiece has to offer. The other ones who can get past its look, be sure that the reward is higher than that.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop doesn't follow a typical story, which only adds to its uniqueness. Its episodic and that means every episode = a new story to be told in this MASSIVE universe. Its strange how no one wants to do another series in this universe, not following the past characters. But i can understand that, because no one will repeat the succes of what Shinichiro Watanabe and Yoko Kanno did. Nonetheless, every episode is interesting and i wasn't bored a single time.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The Art is amazing, but i can see that someone will not like it. Well, good then.  The future is still very believable and i'd rather have this future than Star Wars and such.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The Sound is as good as it gets. Seriously. No other anime has what CB has packed in 4 discs i believe. The Jazz... enough words.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The Characters deserve a special spot in my soul. I will always remember the charming Spike, experienced Jet, lost Faye and crazy Ed.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This is without a question, the best anime out there. Go watch it right now. You can thank me later.

            Imagine Bruce Lee and Quentin Taratino's love child grew up and decided to make an anime after viciously fighting tigers in a jungle with nothing but a sharp stick. Ladies and gentlemen, that anime would be Cowboy Bebop. I often view Cowboy Bebop as the "devil" of anime. Not because it's particularly bad, but in fact it's quite the contrary. When you sign a deal with the devil, what happens? You get what you want, and the devil gets your soul. And in this case, you get the best entertainment you'll ever have in your life, but your soul is now being vastly devoured by
            <span id="review179635" style="display: none;">
             anime shows.
             <br>
              <br/>
              Story: 9/10 - Cowboy Bebop is a bit different than other anime because it's plot vastly depends on the episodes (rather than it being a continuous plot throughout the series), to the point where it kinda mirrors a lot of American cartoons in it's story telling format. However, I still do HIGHLY recommend you watch all the episodes. Not only are all of them tremendously entertaining, but a lot of elements from certain episodes come back later as important plot. The overarching plot is pretty simple, the show follows two partners: Spike and Jet who've had rough pasts and run off to become space bounty hunters in a future society where inter-planetary travel isn't just possible, but also widely used. Overtime there spaceship (the Bebop) gains more and more members: A women with and attitude (Faye), a corgi with enhanced intelligence (Ein), and a superhacker (Who is just a little girl with SEVERE ADHD named Edward).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art: 10/10 - The art itself especially deserves praise because Cowboy Bebop came out before digital animation was widely used... and it's STILL better animated than a hell of a lot of modern anime. The fight scenes are still very fluid for it's time and still holds up to the very day.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound: 10/10 - Want to hear the best fucking dub in existence? Look no further than Cowboy Bebop. This show has vastly been considered to have the best dub in anime history, and it came out an era where not much was expected in the dubbing process. As for the soundtrack? Well, Cowboy Bebop relies heavily on it's music as it's loaded with jazz/blues. And if you're a music fan this anime is LOADED with classic rock references... try and see if you can guess them all.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Character: 9/10 - All the main characters that I listed above were all very dynamic and lovable in their own right, but my one and only problem with the characters are the side characters. A lot of times you'll get a very interesting side character who only gets 20 minutes of screen time, and you'll never see him/her... again. However, ALL the main characters are amazing in every way, shape, and form. Spike and Jet are total bad-asses, Faye makes a great seductress for the show (and has a very interesting back story), and Edward is one of the greatest comic reliefs in anime history. Not to mention fucking Vicious, the main antagonist of the show who trained beside Spike.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoyment: 10/10 - One of the many things that makes Cowboy Bebop so interesting is the fact they are willing to laugh at subjects that most anime wouldn't DARE to touch. Drugs (The Shroom episode... oh god the shroom episode), sex, transvestites, gruesome murders, gambling, and humans who have been heavily experimented on... this anime has 'em all! There is no such thing as limits when it comes to this show, because limits are for pussies! I personally found every single episodes filled with entertainment that had me hooked from start to finish.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This show is not called a classic because it's made in the late 90's, it's called a classic because it fucking deserves the title. If you are looking for a show that steps beyond the boundaries of other anime, and a show where just watching it will cause your chest hair to grow by about 3 inches, than Cowboy Bebop is the show for you! Overall: 9.5/10

            Cowboy Bebop: asteroid blues and cats on mars (minor spoilers)
            <br>
             All good things must come to an end, whether they be shows, summers, or even friendships. But that doesn't mean those things didn't matter, and that certainly doesn't mean many more good things won't follow. That just means you're living in the real world.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             From the opening scene, Cowboy Bebop leaves a tinge of sadness; a bouquet of crumpled flowers, hailing rain and a man regretfully leaving it all behind. Bebop presents an array of complex themes yet provides simple and satisfying answers, whilst doing it in a jazzy and stylistically innovative manner.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             “I’m not going
             <span id="review377920" style="display: none;">
              there to die, I’m going to see if I’m truly alive.”
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Spike, as best stated by himself, is a living ghost. Once a man who found identity in his gang, friends and his woman, Spike lost it all and is left with a heavy soul and a weight to carry. An old comrade resurfaces as a villain, mocking and taunting him, tearing at old wounds and calling upon great emotions of anger and regret. Cowboy bebop plays with Spike’s lost identity and his obsession with the past subtlety, displaying a façade of an easy-going, all-knowing cowboy, yet flashing uncertainty and melancholy in the sheen of his miscoloured eyes. Cowboy Bebop’s master stroke is the expertise juggling of light-hearted, fun bounty hunting and the tragic, regretful pasts of the main cast which is always there, in the shadow of the various adventures the crew embarks on. The viewer knows it’s there, yet they are able to appreciate the fun, nonsensical moments all the same. As a show of multiple identities, reflected in the cast, cowboy bebop can be seen as a genre of it’s own.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The characters aboard the Bebop truly have character (although they may lack an affirming identity). Their intense races to score each bounty, playful jeering and mopey shenanigans evoke all the feelings one could possibly feel; pure joy and excitement, yet deep inside, as Cowboy Bebop so expertly portrays, the feeling of melancholy. The characters, as well as they mesh and bounce off each other, have all left something behind and are simply living with regret. Faye copes with becoming disconnected from everything and everyone she ever cared for, not being able to grow up and experience the real youth she was meant to, Jet copes with his unintentional selfishness  leading to his woman leaving, and Spike copes with being betrayed by a good friend and losing the love of his life. Yet, as subtlely as Cowboy Bebop portrays melancholy, it also tells us that everything will be alright, that if even this rag-tag group of vagabonds can come together, then maybe they did find something real. That despite losing all external links to identity, there is always the possibility of finding more meaning in life.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop’s structure may be as complex as it’s themes, it’s an episodic show with a few episodes which depict the cast’s overarching stories. While many episodes have something to say, some are just pure, unfiltered fun. Some instil great fear and terror, others inspire friendship and love. In the background, the past lives of the characters methodically unravel, presenting only the necessary information. Blink once and you could miss it all! The viewer can take Cowboy Bebop as shallow or as complex as they want, it’s truly an enjoyment for everyone. It even blares every type of music you could like: heavy metal, Japanese pop, lounge, swing, chorale and scat-singing, among other styles, as well as the usual blues and jazz pieces. Whether it’s a slow, romantic drink in a bar or a thrilling ship-chase, the music only adds and never subtracts. It pulls you into a thrilling symphony of visuals, sounds and excitement, many times evoking great synaesthesia. The stunning art and animation cannot be discredited either, inspiring great awe or intimacy in the vastness of space. Cowboy Bebop blends all of the classic Anime elements together with multicultural influence and innovative sound design, truly inventing a genre of its own.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The motif of dreams is often repeated by Spike and crew, that sometimes life seems like a dream, and only now that the past has departed that they feel awake. Take this as you will, but I believe that it’s telling us to keep moving forward, that time is unrelenting. In its cathartic finale, some of Bebop’s characters move on, and some don’t. Whatever your choice, you’ll forever carry the weight of the past; but don’t let that weigh down your future.
              <br/>

            I was kind of disappointed with this series. I didn't really know anything about it going in, but it'd been hyped up by a friend of mine and it's one of the "classic anime" that many people seem to love, so I had high expectations.
            <br>
             <br/>
             I think a big issue for me with the series is the episodic nature of it. It got pretty repetitive with many episodes having the general premise of "Here's this week's criminal. How will the team catch him/her and collect the bounty?" While most of the episodes were still entertaining to watch, I would've liked there to be a more cohesive
             <span id="review336532" style="display: none;">
              overarching plot. The climax of the series is built up over only a few episodes and kind of comes out of nowhere, like it was just thrown in to end the series.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The lack of a cohesive overarching plot fits the characters, but it doesn't make the most enjoyable story, imo. I don't want to give too many details to avoid spoilers, but to put it simply, the episodic nature of the series fits the characters taking things one day at a time and not necessarily moving toward a certain goal. I can appreciate that parallelism/artistic decision, but it doesn't make the series more enjoyable for me.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Despite it being pretty dated at this point, I enjoyed the art style. I'd even say the dated animation/art style works in favor of the series because it fits the "Western" vibe of the show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The sound was really good. I watched the first couple episodes dubbed and the rest subbed and thought the voice acting was good in both of them. I think the voices fit the characters well, but there was a voice or two that really annoyed me. I really liked the music too, especially the OP.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I liked the characters, and I think they each received sufficient character development. Throughout the series, you get hints about the characters' backstories sprinkled into certain episodes and near the end of the series, each of them gets an episode or two dedicated to their backstories and what led to them being in their current position.

            “Actually, it’s a very long and dramatic story,” – Jet Black (Episode 23)
            <br>
             <br/>
             I don’t think there has been a stronger unity between a series and its protagonist than the dramatic 26-episode story of Cowboy Bebop and Spike Spiegel, a series that is exactly like its protagonist and a protagonist that is exactly like its series. For example, Goku was the ideal fit for Dragon Ball Z, a powerful young man known for screaming while in combat and (on a lesser note) for not being there when he’s needed the most; the series is also known for the same two things, the second one being that
             <span id="review199269" style="display: none;">
              the series lacks in plot and characterization when it needs it the most. Another example I have is Master Keaton and the titular character of that series, Taichi Keaton. Taichi is a man who should be interesting due to him being a man of many occupations but he comes across as boring just like how the series itself should be interesting due to it being a Naoki Urasawa work but it also comes across as boring. However, I think no protagonist is more suited to a series than Spike Spiegel is to Cowboy Bebop. Spike is a bounty hinter with a past as a former gangster, a native of Mars always hungry for some quick cash. With his wispy dark green Afro and a cigarette in his mouth, Spike journeys from planet to planet in a stylish red fighter plane searching for criminals to apprehend. In the beginning of Cowboy Bebop, Spike was simply a rambunctious young man with dislikes galore and an unceasingly stubborn attitude. Throughout the series, my appreciation for our hard-smoking protagonist grew as Spike became someone who easily flowed between exuding laid-back charm and rugged intensity, as someone who matured to appreciate what he once disliked (kids, dogs, and women with attitude), and as someone who alternated between simple methods and extravagant approaches to solve problems. Actor Steve Blum knows, above all else, how to make a character interesting and Blum was at his all-time best in his role as Bebop’s beloved bounty hunter. Spike Spiegel, the “space cowboy” that the series consistently references, dominated every scene of Cowboy Bebop from the first (a black-and-white shootout) to the last (where Spike spoke one final word, fueling memories of Citizen Kane).

              “They are sick and tired of conventional, fixed style jazz,” – Words in Theme Song
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Jazz is the definitive sound of Cowboy Bebop, a genre of music closely associated with the word “cool”, and the jazzy songs in Bebop are far from one-dimensional, the songs a passion-filled combination of fast-paced and slow. Bebop’s soundtrack not only contains jazz; there’s also western-themed tracks, hard rock, hypnotic blues, soft rock with English lyrics (extremely rare in anime), and even some bongo beats. At one point, Cowboy Bebop ventures into the classical genre at one point by sampling a famous piece (Tchaikovsky’s “Waltz of the Flowers” in episode 11). The two things I love most about Bebop’s soundtrack are the theme song and the ending theme. “The Real Folk Blues” has the enviable honor of being Bebop’s ending theme, a soulful soft rock song accompanied by a collection of grainy black-and-white images (My favorite part of the ending theme is when the singer says “The re-al FOLK! Blues…” Powerful stuff, man). If you’re reading this review, I know you’ve heard Bebop’s legendary theme song already, an intense, fast-paced jazzy track with a blues guitar in the beginning and a hyperactive horn near the end. Of course, there’s more to Cowboy Bebop than the theme song but man, what a theme song it is!

              “Don’t leave things in the fridge,” – Spike Spiegel (Episode 11)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The four main characters don’t merely leave their pasts in the fridge; they allow it to linger until it comes back to bite them. Jet Black is an ex-cop/bounty hunter and the pilot/mechanic of the ship Bebop, a gruff Russian cook with a soft spot. I think actress Wendee Lee delivered a much better performance as Bebop member Faye Valentine, a cigarette-smoking enigma with a gambling addiction, than she ever did as the soft-spoken voice of Azusa Fuyutsuki in Great Teacher Onizuka (Faye’s first scene in Cowboy Bebop is simply unbelievable). As much as I like Spike, Jet, and Faye, my favorite character in the series has to be the one and only Edward Wong Hau Pepulu Tivrusky the Fourth (‘Edward’ or ‘Ed’ for short), a skinny red-headed adolescent girl who specializes in computer hacking, talks in the third person, and injects a unique enthusiasm into every scene she’s in. Throughout the series, a plethora of supporting characters are brought to the fold, from a talking computer program to a homely, rock-loving trucker (The most interesting of these are a trio of elderly Hispanic bickerers that show up in the series again and again). There are also characters in Cowboy Bebop that only appear for one episode but receive more depth than characters in different series earn in a season, like the eccentric cowboy Andy, Mad Pierrot the flying psychopath, Wen the immortal harmonica player (the spiritual predecessor to Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood’s Pride), and Elisa, Jet’s former girlfriend. Cowboy Bebop is so phenomenal a series that even characters that don’t amount to much end up being celebrated as classic examples of characterization. Of course, I’m talking about Bebop’s main antagonist Vicious, a white-haired swordsman who never really stood out to me besides having a creepy voice. Other than Vicious, Bebop’s characters are well-acted, complex, and (above all) interesting.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              You could argue that Cowboy Bebop isn’t a great series because of its overly episodic plot, the unresolved issues of some of the side stories, and its lack of a legitimately great villain. These are all good points to use in an argument but I’d have two words for you: screw you. Cowboy Bebop is the rare anime series that combines multiple genres into one: mystery, space western, film noir, comedy, blaxploitation, action, philosophical drama, pulp fiction, and even horror (only in episode 20). Every great series has classic scenes but very few series contain scenes as poignant as the ones in Cowboy Bebop; there’s the Cathedral Fall Scene (where images of Spike’s past are revealed with beautifully creepy singing), the Hidden Film Scene (where a younger version of a certain character encourages the viewer in what’s easily the most heartbreaking scene of Bebop), and the Final Fight scene (where Spike finally confronts his past by blowing away his enemies in dramatic fashion), these three scenes distinguishing themselves from the others. Even the episode previews are great, from Spike’s hilarious rant in the episode 6 preview to Jet’s critical review in the episode 18 preview, from Faye’s glorifying speech about love in the episode 15 preview (much to Spike and Jet’s displeasure) to Mad Pierrot’s unforgettable laughing in the episode 20 preview, and (my personal favorite) Edward’s announcement that the series is over during the episode 12 preview. While watching this series, the one thing that confused me the most was the issue of the characters running in motion during the theme song. “Why are they doing this?” I asked myself. Then I figured, “Maybe they too are trying to watch Cowboy Bebop.”

            ***I originally posted this review on Anime-Planet***
            <br>
             <br/>
             Critic's Log: Earthdate - March 12, 2012. Review #1: Cowboy Bebop.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             It is the year 2071 and Mars has become the central hub of human civilization ever since a hyperspace experiment on the moon failed and made Earth uninhabitable. The entire Solar System has been accessible thanks to reliable hyperspace gates and crime syndicates have exerted their power and influence over the government and the ISSP (Inter-Solar System-Police). As a result, The ISSP has put in a bounty system similar to The Old West has been included to deal with fugitives, terrorists and other criminals. The bounty hunters are usually
             <span id="review87775" style="display: none;">
              called "Cowboys". Bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black are flying around space and trying to catch their bounty.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              That is the premise of Cowboy Bebop. This is where I start to get technical, Cowboy Bebop does not have much of a main storyline (except for episodes like Ballad of Fallen Angels, the Two-part episode Jupiter Jazz and the two part finale The Real Folk Blues), and those 5 episodes are what you could call "plot" episodes, while the remaining 21 are standalone episodes. With that said, those episodes are not even considered filler. Some of the ideas in these standalone really stand out impressively. Here are some examples: Sympathy for the Devil, Waltz for Venus, Ganymede Elegy, etc., etc...
              <br/>
              <br/>
              If there is a blinding aspect, it is the animation. For 1998, the animation was pretty good back then and still looks good today. Some episodes have some cool animation effects as well. Sunrise is the animation studio behind Cowboy Bebop and that might not be saying much, however there is one apparent note about this show, apparently Cowboy Bebop's success led to 3 staff members from Sunrise that co-founded the studio that we know today as Studio Bones. In other words, animes like RahXephon, Wolf's Rain, Eureka Seven, Darker than BLACK, Soul Eater, and both Fullmetal Alchemist animes were apparently made possible due to Bebop's success. The action scenes are well animated, and the visuals are even breathtaking at times.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              If there are any anime purists out there that have not seen Cowboy Bebop yet, consider this recommendation an exception, the English dub is very good and hardly flawed. Steven Jay Blum gives Spike a good badass tone to his character, Wendee Lee sounds both sexy and sensitive as Faye, Beau Billingslea has a cool father-like tone as Jet, and Melissa Fahn is charmingly silly as Edward. The dub can be considered better than the original Japanese version of the show, and I have known some purists that mention that Cowboy Bebop's dub was very good. I personally love the dub, it was spot-on and all the voices matched. So, what do I think of the subtitled version? Answer: I find it Underrated compared to the dub. The voice cast of the subtitled version had some well-known voice actors such as Kouichi Yamadera, Megumi Hayashibara, Unsho Ishizuka, and even Norio Wakamoto is in the subbed version. There is nothing wrong with the subtitled version; it may be a bit overshadowed by the dubbed Version
              <br/>
              <br/>
              f there is an aspect that struck all the chords right is the soundtrack which is by Yoko Kanno. Some people consider Bebop's soundtrack to be her best. There is one fact about the soundtrack is that Kanno-san formed a band known as The Seatbelts which includes over 70 musicians which resided in Japan, New York, and Paris. I consider it impressive. If you try listening to the soundtrack without the show, it may feel like you're listening to an album rather than a soundtrack. The soundtrack really made a permanent impression on me. My personal favorite moment that involved the soundtrack was the two songs used in the cathedral scene, which were Rain and Green Bird. Hell, the opening theme kicks so much ass, and The Real Folk Blues is a good closing theme. The soundtrack is groovy
              <br/>
              <br/>
              What really makes the show impressive is that some scenes have music playing and not have much dialogue in it. This is somewhat of a symbolic example that silence can indeed be golden. This is Kanno-san’s most famous and critically acclaimed soundtrack. Otakus mostly rejoice when Kanno –san is involved in musical compositions ever since she finished her work on Cowboy Bebop. She is mostly a fan favorite in the anime fan base when it comes to the music department and that should come as no surprise. She’s that popular and talented. I do appreciate the work she has done up to this very day.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The characters are also great. Spike is shown as a rogue badass with a past catching up to him. Jet appears to be a cool guy who happens to be the Captain of the Bebop. Faye is a con-woman and an interesting character even though she is kind of rude. Ein is adorable, and Edward is a silly random character that has a positive outlook in life. I think she was an awesome character for comic relief in the show. Some minor characters were also interesting. There is a common theme that runs through all of the characters and that is the pasts of these characters. It's definitely an overused trope but I think the past is something we all quite can't forget which doesn't make this trope clichéd, it's just a common one that is almost always effective.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop claims to be a genre unto itself. I am not sure how to give a clear analogy on that, but it has interesting themes that are unique to the show. There are some homages and send ups to famous movies in this show. This is a show that knew how to treat adults and people who like movies, music, Science Fiction, Western and so forth. Shinichiro Watanabe really nailed the direction of this anime because he always liked to mix up different opposing styles to make something completely new and unordinary. Cowboy Bebop has elements of Western, Space Opera, Film Noir, Martial Arts, and Jazz music. All these elements blended extremely well and this was a very unique anime at the time and I can understand why this anime was so revolutionary at the time. End Result: WINNING!
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Since the popularity of Cowboy Bebop soared past through the stars, is it even fair to say that this show is overrated? It is considered an influential anime and I see why, a lot of people have universally praised the hell out of this show. The stories, animation, characters, music, and style are blended in so well that it almost makes it hard to see animes of this caliber.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              If there is a drawback, I could say that this show could have gone a bit longer, and on a personal note, Boogie Woogie Feng Shui was the only episode I did not like too much. If you like it, that's fine.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              If you stick to the series long enough, I guarantee you'll like the ending. There are a lot of people that see the ending as one of the most fitting endings to an anime and it really ends with a bang. I'm dead serious, if you haven't seen this series then do yourself a favor and watch the damn show, it will not disappoint you unless you are extremely picky.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is available by Bandai Entertainment, and even though Bandai Entertainment no longer licenses anime, they mentioned that they will keep their current catalog, so apparently there's nothing to worry about this anime being out of print in the US (I hope). The manga adaptation Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star written by Hajime Yatate and illustrated by Cain Kuga and another manga adaptation of Cowboy Bebop also written by Hajime Yatate and illustrated by Yutaka Nanten were available by Tokyopop and It is possible that those two manga adaptations are out of print. Cowboy Bebop the Movie is available by Sony Pictures and I will review it next.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              With that said, Cowboy Bebop is a smash hit jam-session that has become a genre unto itself; it has thrills, action, humor, and most of all fun. It is a hard one not to like. However, Not only anime fans like this show, some people that don't watch anime much or even anime-haters admit this show is exceptional and they even liked the show. This show has an American influence and it appeals to viewers that like anime, sci-fi, action flicks, and westerns. At the time I am posting this, this anime is still airing on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block since 2001. The constant re-runs and the fan base have turned this anime to a cult classic (metaphorically speaking, it has a devoted fan base... nothing to do with religious cults or something like that; it's a play on words). It may not be everyone's cup of tea but it is definitely worth trying. It's an anime I sometimes quote as well as some others. Some will say that this is the greatest anime ever made, but that may be stretching it too much, but I will agree in calling it a revolutionary anime and a fun anime at that.  it is truly a gem.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I give Cowboy Bebop a 10 out of 10 (It is a MASTERPIECE!)
              <br/>

            What can I say about this that hasn't been said before?
            <br>
             <br/>
             This was the show that got me into anime, which looking back at how much time I've lost to it since might not have been such a good thing. There's just something about this, it's easy to feel but hard to pin down. The characters have incredible chemistry, the english dub is one of the best ever recorded, the art style is beautiful and stands up well for it's age, and the soundtrack is probably the strongest I've ever heard. You can tell that the creators had a lot of fun making this because there
             <span id="review203427" style="display: none;">
              are so many unique pieces that all fit together in the end product. It's sort of timeless, and I don't think it'll ever stop feeling cool. I keep this show about 5 feet from the DVD player at all times, and this is the first show I recommend to anyone asking me about getting into anime. It's not nostalgia, it's just great. Without a doubt, it was the best of 1998, which had Trigun, Serial Experiments Lain, and Outlaw star all come out then too. If you haven't seen it, but you watch anime, what is wrong with you? This is one of the biggest pillars in anime history, you owe it to yourself to see it.

            This was a tough watch for me, basically because I'm not into episodic storys and most of the episodes seemed like more or less good fillers. In the end i wished i only watched the 5 very enjoyable Vicious episodes and maybe the Jet and Faye background arcs. Especially episode 5 was a great 9/10.
            <br>
             <br/>
             The optics were mostly good except for the computer generated parts that was horribly upscaled for the bluray release, animation was superb and the soundtrack was a pleasant experience. I would recommend to watch only the 10 best rated episodes to make it not as protracted.

            I'm going to be quite honest here, most episodic anime, such as Cowboy Bebop really doesn't do a whole lot for me. But it's strange, in all it's 26 episode glory, Cowboy Bebop has managed to do what no other anime has ever done and that is too ensnare me in it's word right from the beginning never failing in letting me go. Cowboy Bebop is, quite simply, my favorite Anime ever. No other anime has shown me such a perfectly balanced world, with such an awe-inspiring atmosphere dripping with originality like Cowboy Bebop has.
            <br>
             <br/>
             For starters, it's entirely character driven. The show lives and
             <span id="review18642" style="display: none;">
              dies by how it manages to get you to connect with its characters. Cowboy Bebop is one of those rare shows that you don't really need to have a favorite character (although we all do, mine is Spike like most people) because you love all the characters so much you being to sympathize and feel connected with every one of them. It's story is also mixed with a perfect marriage between drama and humor. I've seen people call Cowboy Bebop one of the most depressing anime they've ever seen and I've seen other people call Cowboy Bebop the funniest anime they've seen. The reason it can be so funny without intruding on the seriousness of the plot, is due to the fact that unlike most humor in anime, the humor in Cowboy Bebop is deftly subtle. There are really no instances where the show seems immature or chained to conventional anime humor cliches' and I really can't help but appreciate it all the more. You'll laugh, you'll smile, I wanna say you'll cry, but I didn't, your heart strings will definitely be tugged at a time or seven. The thing the series is most notable for, however, is definitely the music. It's more or less a blend of jazz, blues and contemporary rock that almost blends too naturally with the Space Cowboy setting. Each episode has a different musical theme and the Bebop series really gave me the majority of my favorite anime music.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Listen, I can sit here and talk about how great Cowboy Bebop is all day, but the more I do that, the less time you'll have to sit down and watch it yourself. This is simply one of those anime series that you NEED to watch to call yourself a proper anime fan. I'm not saying you'll love it as much as I do, but if you don't at least give Cowboy Bebop a chance, you're a fool.

            Cowboy Bebop is one of those things that has not aged well. Not because it wasn't a high quality, groundbreaking show that helped to define the genre, but BECAUSE it helped to defined the genre. I'll say now: I didn't grow up with this show. By the time I got around to watching it, I was about 20 and have seen these formulas and characters over and over again. Did Cowboy Bebop do it first? Probably not. Did they do it well? The popularity suggests they did it very very well.
            <br>
             <br/>
             However, over the years people have used this formula so many times that it has
             <span id="review75643" style="display: none;">
              fallen into a cliche. To someone watching it (without nostalgia value) everything is predictable and gets painfully boring painfully fast. There wasn't anything shocking in it, nothing I couldn't see happening 5 episodes beforehand, and every character was one I had seen a million times before and wasn't interested in seeing again.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              If you're asking me for specifics on what I didn't like, I can't even give that many. It was, for me, a totally forgettable experience.  While I would never deny someone their nostalgia, I'd warn newer viewers to check out something a little more fresh.

            Cowboy Bebop is different from other anime in that it does not focus on a linear storyline to progress through the series. It is like a series of short stories that all use the same characters in different scenarios to see how they react when presented with a challenge. However, not all the sessions are disconnected. As we get further into the series, we delve into the past of each character, which gives us a better understanding of how and why each of them act the way they do. This show is more character driven than anything, and because of the memorable characters it provides,
            <span id="review140183" style="display: none;">
             Cowboy Bebop is a masterpiece.
             <br>
              <br/>
              Story/ Pacing - 9/10
              <br/>
              I rate the story a 9 although, as I said before, there is not really a linear storyline. Bebop is not your typical anime in that it is episodic. Each "session" presents the characters with a different problem, whether it be chasing another bounty or solving a personal issue. These are usually resolved within the same session, save for the pair of two-parters and the many questions about the characters and their backstory. In fact, most of the sessions do not seem to be connected because of the difference in plot. However you soon find this to be untrue as more and more is uncovered about the history of each character. The story does not deserve a perfect score because the show's focus is not on the story, but instead atmosphere and the characters.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art - 9/10
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is often seen as a classic anime not only because of the reception it received, but its age. Going on 16 years since its release, it has that retro art feel that can be compared to a Miyazaki film. Every scene is filled with incredible detail, and the characters are no exception. Everything in this anime looks beautiful. There is no laziness in the animation itself, which makes everything flow and look natural.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound/Music - 9/10
              <br/>
              This is a difficult portion to judge. The voices many times are quite grainy and echoey, but it is important to remember that this is an older anime and the sound standards have been improved since its debut. In my opinion it doesn't take away from the show or experience whatsoever, but that is up to the viewer to decide. The music is really what makes the sound category worthy of praise. The introduction song, Tank!, gets you excited for the upcoming events with its fast pace beat and memorable "3, 2, 1, Let's jam" to get things rolling. The music is placed perfectly alongside events so to help convey the emotions of the characters.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters - 10/10
              <br/>
              The characters are really what make this anime special. All of them bring a unique personality to the table, making the crew well rounded. These differing personalities do clash, but nonetheless, it is obvious how close the crew gets. All of them have mysterious pasts that are uncovered as you progress through the series. Every question that comes up should be answered by the end (depending on how you view the series conclusion). As I've stated before, the show's primary focus is on the history of each character and their individual desires regarding resolving personal crises. They are truly a memorable cast and are the main reason this show is a classic.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoyment - 10/10
              <br/>
              This section is much less objective than the others because someone can tell you all the contributing factors that make a show good or bad but it is up to the viewer to decide whether or not they actually enjoy it. I found it incredibly easy to enjoy because the pacing is never slow and something interesting is always happening. This is thanks to the episodic nature of the series, which allows almost every session to tell another story.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall - 9/10
              <br/>
              This show is a masterpiece. It's aesthetic value alone makes it a work of art. The Wild West influences and incredible amount of musical references make it appealing to a wide demographic. The use of sessions rather than linked episodes catalyzes a pace and storyline that both make the series very entertaining. The characters are all unique and very easy to get attached to. All these elements came together to create the perfect storm that is Cowboy Bebop. If you have not seen it already, I highly recommend that you take the time to do so.

            Cowboy Bebop is a popular high rated anime though many people finds it bad and it is  dropped a lot. Am I surprised of either one of both? Actually not. I am one of the few who is in between of them. So I can understand the arguments of both sides. This is a difficult serie for me to rate. Since the things they have done good are extremely good however for the bad things counts the same. Trying to guide you aswell as me trough my thoughts. Isn’t the most obvious thing to do. But I will give it a try.
            <br>
             <br/>
             So lets begin
             <span id="review141455" style="display: none;">
              with the story: It is basically about bounty hunters from the year 2072. These bounty hunters are referred as cowboys a lot in the serie and bebop is the name of their spaceship, if I am not mistaken. So that is where the title comes from. I don’t think there is anything else important to know for now.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The first thing I would like to tell you about the serie is that it is very episodic (If that is even a word). I meant that every episode tells its own story and all those stories gives an idea of their life. I personally don’t like that fact because then you cannot be sucked in the serie as it is supposed to be. That is another reason why I had difficulties to get into the serie and I think that is probably one of the reasons why so many people dropped this anime. On top of that some episodes felt bad and a lot felt like they are fillers. However the good episodes where very good and very amusing to watch. Thats why it is very difficult to criticize the story. Simply because it exist out of 24 different stories. I just don’t like to put a number on the whole bunch and if I would do it on the whole serie it won’t be good either, since it doesn’t has a real plot or something because of this. But I can tell that my rating of these stories goes from 3 to 9 with the higher numbers in the end. Probably cause I started to appreciate the style more. Though the end isn’t built up as good as the other anime series, it is really good and suits the anime perfectly.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I am not really a sci-fi fan, especially things like star wars. This was completely different though. They didn’t put any attention to the future gadgets. I think they did it just for some more spectacular action scenes with those ships. It gave me actually more the feeling that it happened in the past then in the future. especially with those old (beautiful) drawings and the jazz, blues, classic background music. This is all positive in my opinion though. I really like the serie way better as it is.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Guess it is time to go more positive now the worse part of it is done. The best part of the serie for me was without doubt the music. The way they make blues, jazz and classic music exiting is unbelievable! Or is it that what makes the serie exciting? To be honest I don’t know, the only thing I know is that it perfectly suits each other. The way they made the combination let even me enjoy classic music. They really overmastered James Bond with it. Cowboy Bebop just puted Jazz music in the action scenes While James Bond need those good action scenes to get popular. The way they add those weird random sounds at it is really risky. But it is done so great that I love it. The fact that it is so original makes it good. I can understand that a lot of people (especially the younger ones) cannot appreciate that music and surely not in this way. But for me it just made the serie.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The characters are pretty good to. Especially Jet and Spike (the main characters) in my opinion. the other ones aren’t bad but they didn’t got me that much. Probably because The episodes where a new character joins are boring in my opinion. But I must admit that they are all very original. The episodes that goes about Jet and Spike and the way they develop them (slowly but good and full of charm) are very good. That is one of the reasons I absolutely fell in love with those characters.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              However the drawings are old and not that good at first sight, I really started to like them. Spike his look, his hair, his poses, his fights, his cigarettes, … It is all just drawn so beautiful. It may look old but it is still full of charm and emotion. Not only Spike is well drawn but he is just the climax of the drawings in this serie.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So that is why I have double feelings for this wonderful seinen serie.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              See You Space Cowboy...

            I gonna be honest with you and I watched all the episodes and it was so unengaging. It must have been one of the best anime of its time but it totally failed to impress me.
            <br>
             <br/>
             All of the characters (except Jet and Faye) are dull and lifeless especially the stereotypical bounty hunter and gangster spike spiegel. He is a wasted character who tries to be compared to Bruce Lee and Lupin the third and Steve Blum's voice acting makes him sound like a creepy pedophile.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Enough the animation and music pull's me in it still make's itself a overrated example of corny neo noir
             <span id="review156835" style="display: none;">
              and western shows that go really bad over time. Even though I like to respect your opinions, this critic is going full swing on how truly awful this anime is.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So in my final verdict I give it a 0 out of 5 for being less than mediocre and more tightened up with a hell load cat shit. For all those professional critics and strong fans who it's perfect we'll it's not and nothing is not my own and and not your opinions too. They call it the greatest anime well I call it when you just get of the toilet after having a horrible stomach ache.

            <br>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop is often considered one of the greatest anime of all time. I’ve considered watching it for a long time, but I never really got around to it until recently. And now that I’ve finally watched it, I regret not watching the show sooner, not only because it was a good series, but also because I think that if it had been one of the first anime that I watched I would’ve liked it a lot more.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Story:
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The story takes place all over the universe in the year 2071. Cowboy Bebop’s story revolves around
             <span id="review165843" style="display: none;">
              four main characters, Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Faye Valentine, and Edward. They are all bounty hunters aboard Jet’s ship the Bebop. My main issue with the series as a whole is how the story is told. It’s told in a way that makes every episode seem like a small stand-alone story. The series was too episodic, and there were very few episodes that actually felt connected to each other. That being said, my favorite episodes were the ones that focused on the backgrounds of the characters, even though an overall plot really didn’t connect all of them. I just wished that Cowboy Bebop had a more focused narrative.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Animation:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I’d heard nothing but good things about the animation in Cowboy Bebop; but, since it came out in 1998, I wasn’t sure how much I would like it. I’m glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the animation. There were times where I thought, “Wow, this was made in 1998?” But there were other times where I thought, “Yeah, this was made in 1998.” Overall, the animation is solid throughout the entire series.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The sound in Cowboy Bebop is one of the best parts of this series. The whole sound track has a soulful and jazzy vibe. The only issue I have with the sound is that the only songs that you hear multiple times are the songs of the opening and ending. This isn’t really a bad thing. The opening and ending are both really good, but there are just so many good songs you hear throughout the series that I wish that they would’ve used more often. Most of the songs are episode specific, so the music definitely fits the overall themes and tones of the episode, but you’ll probably never hear those songs again throughout the entire series.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The characters are the most interesting part of this series. They all and have totally different personalities, and reasons for becoming bounty hunters. All of them have a mysterious past, which they are either not willing to talk about or just don’t remember. As I said earlier, my favorite episodes in the series are the ones that focus on the backgrounds of the characters. This is partially because these episodes feel the most connected in terms of an overarching narrative, and also partially because I found those episodes the most entertaining. Spike’s background episodes in particular had the some of, if not, the best action scenes in the entire series. There are also several supporting and side characters in the series, but you usually won’t see them in more than one episode. This is fine because during that one episode that they are in their entire story or reason for being there is explained pretty well.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoyment:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Like I said earlier, I think that if this had been one of the first anime that I’d ever watched I would’ve liked this series a lot more than I do. Don’t get me wrong, Cowboy Bebop is an entertaining series, but it has a very episodic format that took away some of the enjoyment for me.

            Shinichiro Watanabe's undoubtedly most successful series of all time. Cowboy bebop originally aired on Japanese television in-between April and June of 1998 but in Australia were I live originally came out in 2007 airing on ABC2. Cowboy Bebop is a series that everyone has seen and has gathered major success especially in the west garnering a reputation amongst anime fans as one of the great "Classics". Cowboy Bebop was one of the first anime I was ever exposed to, up until meeting the titular bebop crew I had never taken anime seriously, or how I looked at them cartoons. Cowboy bebop introduced me to a
            <span id="review338489" style="display: none;">
             mature side of media I had never experienced before.

              ~The Q and A.~
              <br/>
              <br/>
              1. Q. Should you watch Cowboy Bebop?
              <br/>
              <br/>
              A. This is most definitely a yes. Cowboy Bebop is a series that anyone can watch and enjoy, you don't have to like Sci-fi, you don't have to like Noir and you don't have to like Action. Cowboy Bebop appeals to all audiences. Like Baccano! Cowboy bebop oozes the same western vibes that make it a good anime for beginners to get into. Cowboy bebop undoubtedly is made for a more mature audience who will pick up on the more subtle themes, but Younger audiences can still enjoy bebop, even if your not watching bebop for the subtle themes and messages then it's still a fun action packed ride.

              ~Review Portion~
              <br/>
              <br/>
              [Story 8/10]
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop follows the adventures and sometimes (most of the time) the Misadventures of a small crew of space bounty hunters. Bebop is presented in an episodic way which isn't a bad thing, this just means some of the episodes are gonna be a hit or miss. But with that being said when an episode hits it fucking hits harder than Mike Tyson for example . Session 10, Ganymede Elegy. Jet lands on Ganymede for the first time since he left 8 years ago and he's going to find his former lover/Ex girlfriend, Elisa. Jet is held back by his past (This is a theme between basically every character) and has come back to mend his wrongs and find out why Elisa left him. Up until this episode the crew had faced their fair share of tragedy. But episode 10 for me was the saddest tragedy, It's an episode so vividly engrained into my head and I'll never forget Jet's words.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Another example of an episode that hit would be my actual favourite episode of cowboy bebop ever. Session 5, Ballad of Fallen Angels is probably the best written episode of all time, Spike haunted by his past faces a former comrade and friend from the Syndicate, Vicious. Already from the start the episode was set out to be a good one, They drop the bombshell that Spike is a former member of the Red Dragon Syndicate and when a bounty is put out on a syndicate boss Spike goes to repay an old debt. Ballad fo the fallen angels is endlessly cool and it's the first time we get to see spike's past to such a capacity, before then we knew almost nothing about spike and it's great because we get to see into spikes past. Ballad of the Fallen Angels is the beginnings to some other great episodes like The Real Folk Blues. Ganyemede Elegy and Ballad of the Fallen Angels are amongst a seas of other great episodes, like the aforementioned Real Folk Blue's, Asteroid Blue's, Waltz for Venus, Jupiter Jazz and Speak Like a child. Of course with so many hits there are bound to be Misses (Heavy Metal Queen, Boogie-Woogie Feng-Shui) But overall Cowboy Bebop has good stories, stories that can stand on there own as self contained events.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              [Art 9/10]
              <br/>
              Looking back at Cowboy Bebop the art work and animation are still as good as ever, after 22 years since it originally aired Cowboy Bebop still doesn't look a day old. The animation is pure sakuga, especially during the incredible fight scenes. The character designs are all pretty damn iconic and the art is one of the stand out features.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              [Sound 10/10]
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop has one of the most iconic soundtracks of all time, the OST is made by the Seatbelts, which was created by the legend Yoko Kanno herself. The soundtrack is a space western kinda feel Tracks like waltz for zizi or Too Good Too Bad are classically jazzy or western, while others such as Cat on Mars elicit the more sci-fi elements of the story.  Tank is such an amazing opening it's endlessly jazzy and has some of the best visuals.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Now I haven't seen the sub to Cowboy Bebop but I have seen the dub and the dub is absolutely brilliant, it's one of the few anime dubs that surpasses the sub. Steve Blums amazing voice made Spike one of the most iconic characters of all time Beau Billingslea as the voice of Jet is incredible. The rest of the english dub cast is just incredible solid so I would definitely recommend the dub of the series to anyone who wants to watch cowboy bebop.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              [Character 10/10]
              <br/>
              The characters are the best part of cowboy bebop. Our central cast of Spike, Faye, Edward and Jet are a lot of fun to watch, they all have unique character traits that seperate them from each other. They're all in some capacity haunted by there past experiences and watching them struggle to deal with the past is what makes it so good. Spike is a fun badass, but because of his past with the Red Dragon Syndicate he can't escape his past and is always being followed by it. Jet is the straight man, he's the one who takes control amidst the madness of the other members, but he's also a former cop and because of his time as a cop there's always some new thing popping up about his old line of work. Faye is the sleazy girl who deceives guys, but she also lost her memory and woke up in a world she didn't have any idea about. And Ed is this wacky entertaining computer nerd and genius. she doesn't let her past affect how she views the world. The character on the bebop are always a fun and welcome bunch. Some of the one off characters and some recurring characters are a nice sight to see.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The Villains are always fun, one off villains such as Mad Pierrot and Fad are fun to watch. But Vicious is the Creme De La Creme, he is not only Interesting and fun but he is the direct cause for the most interesting conflict in the entire show, that being Spike and Vicious's relationship as former partner's in the syndicate. Vicious is probably the most important part of the story and has such a huge presence in the story.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              [Overall + Enjoyment 9/10]
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is an endlessly cool and fun anime, it has some of the best visuals, animation, voice acting and writing to be found in any anime and it's one of those must watch anime that anyone who is even this slightest bit interested in the medium must watch. My overall on this is a 9/10.

             "I'm not going there to die. I'm going to see if I'm alive" - Spike Spiegel.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I don't know if you are aware of what you are living now. You were born to see masterpieces like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Steins;Gate, Neon Genesis Evangelion... You are lucky enough to enjoy your life, your hobbies without any kind of problem, to get yourself wrapped by different stories or characters. You are lucky enough to exist in the same timeline as Cowboy Bebop, the BEST anime ever created. You think you can argue on this? Well, you CAN'T.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             90s were a strange time for anime. We had
             <span id="review305715" style="display: none;">
              experiments like Neon Genesis Evangelion, a mecha deconstruction. We had Serial Experiments Lain, a pioneer in the internet design. We had Revolutionary Girl Utena, Trigun... In 1998, Sunrise hired director Watanabe Shinichiro to direct an anime. They didn't care what that anime was about. They wanted something that was interesting enough to sell some figures. So, Shinichiro Watanabe, well known today for mixing samurais and hip-hop as well, mixed Cowboys, Jazz and space. What a shitty combination! Don't you think? You're totally wrong. After three or four episodes, Cowboy Bebop was delayed to late-night and there, he gained popularity, until becoming what is known to be the 'anime for adults' for excellence.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop does not have a normal story. To be fair, I'd say that Cowboy Bebop has multiple stories, because every single chapter is like having a new one in our heads. Basically, bounty-hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black travel in their ship, the Bebop, hunting criminals for money. From there, they know femme-fatale Faye Valentine and super-hacker Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV, or as we know it, Ed. As a single crew, with their personal diferences but as a team, they do their jobs. Every character has a development arc, but most important is Spike's one. He, as an ex-member of a criminal syndicate called the Red Dragon, has to deal with his past. Not only does Cowboy Bebop has amazing individual chapters but also has the BEST ending I've ever seen in an anime.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The animation and character design are GORGEUS. Every fight, every new character we meet, every scenario, are specially designed to fulfill our desires. Explosions, flights, races and every single frame on this work is absolutely outstanding, to the point that I am still waiting to be as impressed as I am with Cowboy Bebop (TV show) in animation.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The sound is one of the most important parts in the series, because of the sensation it gives to the viewer. Bebop has that jazzy design on purpose, and Yoko Kanno, with The Seatbelts, make possible that immersion.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is a metaphor to let your past behind you and keep going with your actual life, and the characters are always trying to remember us that the future is what matters. Do not let your past to haunt you like a ghost, forget about it and keep going. Or face it, in order to put a limit in your back.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              We have ex-police officer Jet Black, who can not forget about his past love, or about the arm he lost. Jet is a really nice guy that always pay his debts and wants to be in good terms with everyone. He cares about the crew like if they were his family and wants them by his side. Jet is always trying to get away of his past, but he keeps things in order to not forget about it (the watch his ex left him or the robotic arm he could have fixed).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              We also have Faye Valentine, a cryogenized woman that has tons of debts. Faye is always running from her past, she wants to remember but it is afraid of what that memories can bring back. Despite her cold-blooded attitude, she deeply cares for the crew, even if it is to build a place where she can be part of.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Ed is the youngest member of the crew. With a positive attitude towards life, she is always searching for new things to do and learn. She has not any kind of past, but she has the role of showing us how you must enjoy every single moment of your life (while you can).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              And finally, the all-time favourite Spike Spiegel. Listen, I love Spike. He's handsome, freaking cool and an awesome person. Despite those obviously positive attributes, he's such a hypocrite. He's always talking about how the past will bury you, but he does not talk about how his own past has buried him to the point that he can't look to the future without looking to the past.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I made this review because I recently ended the series for the second time and I can not believe how much I loved it and enjoyed this rush. Cowboy Bebop will forever be a personal favourite of mine.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So, even if you don't want to carry this weight, even if you don't think you are living in the real world, even if you think that if "easy come, easy go", if you don't have a comrade or if you are an sleeping beast, you can not die without watching Cowboy Bebop at least once.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So... See You, Space Cowboy.

            In my mind, Cowboy Bebop is the perfect show for people you know who say "Anime? What are you, 12?"
            <br>
             <br/>
             It's slick, it's funny, it's serious, and it knows how to avoid anime stereotypes. It has characters that you'll never get tired of, plot twists that will keep you watching up late at night, epic fight scenes, and a soundtrack that is worth shelling out for.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             With that said, let's roll.
             <br/>

             Story: 9
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Though it wanders on occasion, I'd like to say that nearly 100% of the time it's to develop characters further or to add a bit of humor. The Star Trek parody episode was a bit
             <span id="review29801" style="display: none;">
              over the top (but enjoyable), and to me it's hard to enjoy enjoy the filler episodes as much as the ones where sh*t really gets real. But let's delve into those. WOW. The last two episodes of the show are as good as it gets in anime. Not to mention the 5th episode, or the back-to-back ones that take place on Mars. I won't ruin any story elements, but look forward to these. If you take anything from this review, take this: those 5 episodes are worth watching over, and over, and over, for any anime fan.

              <br/>
              It's tough to write a review now for a show that took place as long ago as it did, but I'll give it a shot. It's well drawn, and well animated, but it's nothing mindblowing. I remember seeing the first episode fight scenes and being thoroughly impressed, but for me the main draws of the show were always the music, the characters, and the story. I can't say I've ever been much of an art critic, but for the most part is was aesthetically pleasing. I was certainly impressed by the character design, and the world that the artists created was both interesting and desirable.

              Yoko Kanno honestly outdid herself this time. In all my years of watching anime, this is the first time I've really felt like I NEEDED the soundtrack. Great OP, great songs throughout, great everything. So impressed with what she did here.

              How can you not love Spike Spiegel or Faye Valentine? They're the ones that you'd like to be in real life. To me, it's not just how badass the characters are, it's the ideals they represent. Honor, bravery, and an unwillingness to let anything stand before something that you know in your heart is right. The only comparison that I can make here is a show called Firefly, which isn't an anime but in some ways reminds me of Bebop. Great design, great execution, and I wouldn't get sick of any of them even if the show went on for 100 eps.

            Cowboy Bebop is a whole collection of classic genres, all mixed into one series and all done right, to the point that it breathes new life into a very stale genre. If ever there was a series more deserving to be a sleeper hit, Bebop is it.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Many times have I visited Cowboy Bebop, and every time we've parted company I leave with a sense of how great a conversationalist Cowboy Bebop truly is. How it tells beautiful stories with nothing but ink, paint, computers, and sound. How it seems to transcend it's own media and become something unto itself. Nothing to be worshiped or canonized,
             <span id="review74199" style="display: none;">
              but to be viewed with a measure of respect, and perhaps awe, that such a thing ever took place at all.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop, that's the story. There are cowboys and there is bebop, set against the backdrop of the future and space. The series concerns itself with the lives of Jet Black, Spike Spiegal, Faye Valentine, and Ed. The series itself tends to revolve around sorting out each characters past and reconciling it with their present selves. What sets Cowboy Bebop apart from similar series such as Outlaw Star is that these stories are actually interesting.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The places they visit are far from what one would expect. Instead of Neo-Tokyo with its shiny, impossibly tall skyscrapers that never end, we have Neo-Tijuana, with its dusty dirt roads, run down shacks and migrant workers. Space is ethnic, but not in the Star Trek sanitized for the sake of politically correctness way. Each colony reflects a melting pot more akin to Los Angeles or New York City than any Blade Runner wannabe ever could.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters from Cowboy Bebop each have stories to tell. Each deals with its past and present as best they can, although often times not very well at all. The plot is linear as far as the time line is concerned, but there isn't a penultimate goal sought after. In terms of the classic definitions of conflict, Cowboy Bebop tends towards the man versus himself, or man versus man types of conflict. The principles of Cowboy Bebop do not seek paradigm shifts, do not seek to change the world for the better or worse, but simply to live to see another day. This struggle to live on is what makes Cowboy Bebop so enjoyable, and what gives a humanity to the principle characters that they would otherwise lack.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Animation directors strive for different goals. Some, like Hayou Miyazaki seek a balance between we humans and nature. The director of Ghost in the Shell, Mamoru Oshii forewarned us that advancement without restraint presented dillemas with no solutions. Shincihiro Wantanbe gave us, with Cowboy Bebop, twenty-six pictures of a world coming to terms with its past. The methods vary, with death, resignation, and an eyes wide shut attitude dominating.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              But never are these heady themes forced upon us with a heavy hand. They are at many times hidden behind sharp humor, attention to detail, and jaw dropping animation. Only two times are these themes truly brought to a head: at the twelfth and thirteenth episodes (parts one and two of Jupiter Jazz), and episodes twenty-five and twenty-six (parts one and two of The Real Folk Blues). And at these moments the music gets better, the animation sharper, and like true climactic moments, they stay with us long after we finish watching them. Everything in Cowboy Bebop seems to breathe with life and motion, even in otherwise stoic scenes, and it's a rarity and a marvel to behold.

              Never before or since has such a catalog of music been assembled for an anime, any anime. The principle creator of Cowboy Bebop's music, Yoko Kanno, took the high-road. She hopped from genre to genre in leaps and bounds while never taking from the animation itself, but infusing it with a pulse that at all times seemed perfect. Sometimes characters are defined through music, like Gren, whose sax playing pronounces him melancholy, disillusioned, and cavalier. Three original soundtracks were put together for this anime, each one is distinct and non-repetitious. Listening to them on their own gives you new appreciation on the quality of Yoko Kannos gift.

              The concept of Cowboy Bebop is not original, but its execution is outstanding. The characters are not original, but how they interact with the world around them is. The music can be defined by genre, but the impact on the individual cannot. The animation has been topped over the years, the cgi definitely shows its age, but there are still moments of raw beauty that are still unparalleled. Cowboy Bebop is not a rite of passage in anime fandom, but it should be a signpost, showing you the difference between the sublime and the ordinary.

            There are quite a lot of anime that have a western setting, yet it is rare to see ones that contain the typical "wild west" feeling, much less portray in a convincing manner, in which viewers may associate it to adventure and mayhem, rash shootings and cowboys. While this may seem generic, Cowboy Bebop is a character driven story that came as a very pleasant surprise, as it managed to transmit magnificently such theme, with several tweaks to the setting itself. Furthermore, even when it was for the majority of the series of episodic nature, it managed to properly narrate a story with very interesting
            <span id="review210097" style="display: none;">
             and varied episodes, whilst fleshing out its cast accordingly; which is difficult and rare in the medium.
             <br>
              <br/>
              ~Story~
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The story of Cowboy Bebop is centered on the members of the spaceship "The Bebop", Spike and Jet, a drifter and retired cyborg cop whose profession is bounty hunting for a living. They meet a lot of odd characters, in which Faye and Ed are one of the main highlights. As mentioned earlier, what is curious is the context of the series: it has its setting in the year 2071 in which humanity has left earth and settled themselves amongst the stars. What is more, it came together with the collapse of nations, and thus the emergence of disorder, violence, freedom and wild shootings -  it has the typical western "cowboy" feeling attached to it. It also shares it moments of comedy here and there, which are subtly and well introduced in several occasions without breaking immersion in the story.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This anime is for the major part of the series of episodic nature, yet what is remarkable is the variety within these. Each has its own unique and intriguing story, be it the virus that turn humans into monkeys, the classic parody to the Alien movie, the wacky cowboy, you name it. What further enhances the experience is the fact that each episode provides a feeling of continuity, including great world building showing the viewer how 2071 is, in addition to developing and fleshing its cast accordingly along the way. Some may argue that there are some episodes of lower quality, as it can be hit or miss, yet I found it to be in general of high quality. This doesn't mean the anime doesn't have its share of serious episodes in which actual story progression takes place regarding the characters, in particular that of Spike. These are brimming with life, action and love, giving viewers insight in the characters: it is filled with tension and intrigue. It is worth mentioning that the conclusion of the series is arguably of the most satisfying ones in the anime industry.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ~Characters~
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is a character driven story, and thus the characters are of great importance to the story to make it work properly, and the anime managed to achieve this masterfully. Although the characters may be considered as stereotypes, in this case it is apparent that these can be very interesting when approached correctly. First of all, it must be mentioned that most of the characters have a mysterious background which is not apparent to viewers at first, yet as story progresses, it is slowly revealed in several bits. Ultimately, most of these are portrayed to audiences in a satisfying manner, yet not fully clarified in some cases, which is left for the viewer to imagine. This may be lacluster for some, but in this case it actually works in its favour to maintain the intrigue and splendid atmosphere of the anime.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The members of the spaceship "Bebop" are composed of intriguing and entertaining characters, almost everyone being developed and fleshed out. There is Spike, a calm and cunning, somewhat lazy guy, yet immensely likeable whose motives on staying on the ship are not quite apparent at first, yet with am intriguing past. Then there is Jet, the hard-boiled and hardworking cop, now retired from the profession for bounty hunting instead. Other character of interest is Faye Valentine, a tomboy yet cunning woman, to being at times quite arrogant; but this is all because of her brittle past, which adds to the credibility of her character. Ultimately there is Ed, a superhacker girl, an energetic careless person who acts very childishly; she seems to be there for comical relief, yet it is apparent that she is slowly developed and as well as cunning, albeit in small measures.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Other remarkable aspect of the anime are the interactions with the cast: all of the characters have such diverse personalities that is bizarre to see them all together and interact each other; what ties them together are their common goals, be it revenge, greed, profit, convenience, you name it. The relationships are slowly developed according to their personal development, which was a nice touch to the show. As for the secondary characters and "villains" if you may, these are for the majority quite interesting with sometimes motives, or intriguing past that showcase the hardships of society. Some either serve to enhance the comedy, world building, or the story plot itself.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ~Animation and sound~
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The animation quality of Cowboy Bebop is fantastic, even when considering in aired in the late 90's. The actions scenes, for both combat and space battles, are very fluid giving insight of the whole battle scene to the viewer. In addition, the choreography involved is detailed and feels realistic, further enhancing the experience. As for the art style itself, it is befitting of the atmosphere with very detailed backgrounds; not to mention the great usage of lighting effects to the anime that serves to intone the various atmospheres. The character designs are well done as well, varied and intriguing, matching with the corresponding personalities. However, there were times in which some backgrounds/characters were not as detailed, yet this was a small issue.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Concerning the music score, it is truly outstanding: the use of jazz, blues and classic rock may seem odd considering its setting, yet it fits magnificently with the atmosphere. Each piece is also adjusted to the various situations. The fact that there are 4 CD's with over 80 different pieces composed for the series shows the dedication the studio had for the anime. As for the voice actors, these performed their roles splendidly, matching with the different personalities and intonations used. What came to me as a surprise, is the fact that the english dub was as good (or maybe even better) to the japanese one, which is noteworthy. The openings and endings of the anime were well executed and befitting of the theme, such as Tank!, surely one of the most famous ones.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ~Enjoyment~
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop was overall a great anime, with fantastic characters and their respective development and fleshing out. The soundtracks used in addition to the animation enhanced the viewing experience greatly; the fact that the anime managed to convey an intriguing story despite being of episodic nature was a huge bonus as well. Some viewers may be bothered by this and find them lackluster, as it can be hit/miss for some; the fact that the story is nothing extremely grandiose can be an issue as well, yet at a personal level this was never the case. So do I recommend this anime? I wholeheartedly do to anyone of any demographic, as the characters in conjunction with the animation and sound certainly makes it almost a must watch.
