            You've got be in a certain time at a certain place to appreciate Cowboy Bepop. It's sense of cultural mismatch doesn't excuse it's lack of identity. It pushes style over substance because there is no substance. It's constant homage to everything and anything muddies whatever originality it has.
            <br>
             <br/>
             But at the same time, cowboys in space sounds cool right? Freeform jazz is cool too. Martial arts are cool. Are these the reasons the anime became so famous? Or is it because the 90s meant it had to be viewed on television at whatever time the channels chose to air Japanese cartoons, meaning that the sense of
             <span id="review236071" style="display: none;">
              disconnect was covered up by genuine disconnection? Is it because it was the only good looking anime that could be watched - in English - without cringing?
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Perhaps it's my fault I didn't like Cowboy Bepop. Maybe it's because I chose to marathon it, going 3-4 episodes a day? Maybe it's because it's old? Maybe I'm simply not the target audience? During the duration I gave Cowboy Bebop, I was constantly trying to puzzle together why I didn't like it. Maybe it'll get better, I figured.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The thing is that any logical conclusion I could think of didn't make sense. Other 90s anime include some of my all time favourites like Neon Genesis, Revolutionary Girl Utena and Serial Experiments Lain, so it's definitely not my lack of tolerance towards it's age. I've marathoned tons of shows, and if anything, that tends to make me enjoy them more. I love sci-fi.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              When I finally came to my senses, I finally rejected the idea that Cowboy Bepop is good. I accepted my own opinion, piercing through the thick armour of everybody else's, fuelled by rampant nostalgia and shielded by being overly sympathetic to the show's age.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              With most (x)-of-the-week shows, you figure out quite quickly whether you'll like them or not based on 1 or 2 episodes. I liked Bepop at first, I loved it's sense of style, with a Blade-Runner-like noir universe and fun jazz. But every episode had exactly the same format, with no connections between episode - no hook to make me care. The 20 minute runtime of the show meant that they nose-dived into introducing whoever they chase, they chase them and then they get paid. The action sequences were so drawn out that there wasn't any time for fickle character development or an underlying plot.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Every single list discussing the best characters in anime includes one or two of these characters. After 16 or so mundane episodes, I just couldn't figure this one out. They're bland. Their interactions are cold and sterile with little chemistry. A sense of family was forced upon you, but it only served to remind how stereotypical and cliche Jet's caring side is. Faye's design makes her nothing more than sci-fi modified fanservice, and her character has very little going on inside. Ed is annoying.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              And then we come to Spike, who serves as the show's hero. He's a generic Marty Stu, who's too cool to care about.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bepop amazes me, it really does. The aura of perfection is has, built solely on fond memories of small TVs and awkward schedules, is impressive. But if you take it out of context, the facade falls down. Cowboy Bepop is weekly trash and nothing more.

            If anyone ever asks what my favorite anime is I'll reply, "Cowboy Bebop" without a pause. Its the perfect blend of western and scifi with a hint of noir and any other genre they could manage to fit in there, all supported by some great music.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop has great characters, rich stories, beautiful art, and some of the best music I've ever seen in an anime. The main plot is limited to a small portion of the 26 episodes leaving the other episodes to be largely self contained stories.In this way it is similar to other shows like Gintama that are structured primarily episodaly.
             <span id="review169241" style="display: none;">
              This allows the creators to experiment on every episode with a variety of genres and themes while exploring and developing characters and giving you glimpses of a beautiful and clearly very vast world.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The episodal nature of the anime while being one of its greatest strengths is also its greatest weakness and a small number of episodes are definite misses especially when it comes to the quality of the rest of the anime. However, as these are all stand alone episodes these shortfalls don't detract from the rest of the anime and if you wanted to could easily be skipped.

            There is not much that can be said about Cowboy Bebop that has not already been said. It is considered a classic among classics, and one of the best anime ever created. It's story, art, soundtrack, and characters are truly beloved by many. I have yet to find a person who does not agree with them.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Story:
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop does not have an inherent, flowing story like many other anime. It is mostly episodic, yet still manages to be story (and character, but we'll get to that later) driven. The story revolves around a group of bounty hunters in a dystopian future, searching for bounties to make
             <span id="review101691" style="display: none;">
              a living. I will admit that you may become disengaged toward the middle of the series, but it quickly recovers with several exceptional episodes later on. The premise seems uneventful, and when you think about it, not much really happens in the way of story progression. And yet, the plot-lines are captivating, well created and ultimately satisfying. For this, I give Cowboy Bebop an 8 for story.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art:
              <br/>
              The art is, to be very honest, nothing unique. It has the same 90's anime look that you've seen, but that is not to say it isn't beautiful in it's own right. The design is solid, with nothing looking out of place. While the art style is not original, it has the best execution of that style I've seen. The animation is consistently fluid and impressive, especially during the fighting scenes, in which Spike's movements look amazing. The show just looks good. I give Cowboy Bebop an 8 for art.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound:
              <br/>
              The soundtrack of Cowboy Bebop is often hailed as one of the best, with jazzy tunes mixed in with slow classical compositions. If there is one thing you cannot deny, it is that it's soundtrack is refreshingly varied. However, at points I found that the style of music failed to accentuate the moment at hand. While I found this distracting, the overall song choice is exceptional. As nobody can deny, Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack is among the best in not only any anime, but many shows in general. They would agree that the soundtrack deserves a 9.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Character:
              <br/>
              If there is one thing exceptional about Cowboy Bebop, it is it's three dimensional characters. I am conflicted, even, to call them characters, because they are just so real. Their drives, their conflicts and their pasts are executed seamlessly and exceptionally. Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed are not a means to an end, they are not plot mechanics, they are an insight into actual personalities and how they would react in the dystopian future of the world of Cowboy Bebop. I can imagine, in some parallel dimensional, that these people could exist. They are not caricatures, they are convincingly real characters that give Cowboy Bebop a 9 in the character department.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoyment:
              <br/>
              If there is anything Cowboy Bebop does right, it is that it makes you feel invested and immersed in the world. The culmination of all the previous aspects is a show that is quite simply fun to watch. In the enjoyment department, that is a great thing. I give Cowboy Bebop a 9 for enjoyment.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall:
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop is a classic, there is no denying. The noir genre has had many great contributions, and I believe Cowboy Bebop is of the best of those. I would have given it a 10 had it not been for some minor hiccups. I don't really think anything deserves a ten that I've personally encountered. But I degress, as this is definitely one of the most influential and impressive anime ever created.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I give Cowboy Bebop a 9 out of 10!

            "Why Cowboy Bebop is the greatest anime of all time ?"Well this is the phrase that made me wonder is Cowboy Bebop really that awesome ? Should I watch it? What is so special about it ? These were the questions i first asked myself first .
            <br>
             After a while i decided to go and watch the anime .The first thing that got my attention was Spike Spiegel he is so awesome and cool to the extreme , and to be honest i fell in love at first sight .. However , the first few episodes were okay and I would not lie I
             <span id="review282905" style="display: none;">
              decided to drop the anime because I was expecting something great and I got disappointed at first .
              <br/>
              Then , after a month later , I said to myself "hey I should give Cowboy Bebop a second chance" .
              <br/>
              So , I rewatched it and I noticed that the anime was getting more and more awesome and I got hooked to it . Also , the light was more spotted on Spike's past and there was also a huge developments of the other main characters Faye , Jet and Ed . Suddenly , the last three episodes came like a storm and let me say those episodes were the best three episodes I ever watched in my whole life . However , if you think that Cowboy Bebop has a happy ending then you must think again .
              <br/>
              Aside from the plot , the general theme of Cowboy Bebop is my type , considering that I am into aesthetic lover . Also , the background of it is way too artistic and they took care of small details , you would not believe that this anime was made at 1998 .
              <br/>
              Now about the character's style of the anime , I would say that the took care of the drawing one the main and the side ones .
              <br/>
              Finally , about the soundtracks I would say that Cowboy Bebop's Ost is the greatest considering that I am a jazz lover .
              <br/>
              To conclude , Cowboy Bebop is the best anime of all time and it really worth this title anybody who watch it till the end will fall in love .

            Cowboy Bebop is an anime that seems to feel different depending on what period of your life you're watching it in.
            <br>
             <br/>
             I remember watching this when I was barely in high school, and thought it was just "meh, 6/10". I didn't resonate with the characters, the art style and music wasn't my cup of tea, the plot was near nonexistent, but I loved spaceships and the action was pretty decent.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Fast forward to my mid/early 20's and I gave it a rewatch. At this point in my life, I'm still trying to figure myself out as a person, who I am, what I want to
             <span id="review349271" style="display: none;">
              do with my life, and so forth. Now, I understand Mai a bit more. She's trying to figure out who she is, what she wants out of life, and just winging it as she goes. I care less about art style now and learned to appreciate the amazing upbeat and jazzy soundtrack that the anime gets its name from.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As an adult, going out to the real world after college, I began to be more aware of my surroundings. It's here that I noticed the world building, each episode giving a glimpse into what the Bebop universe is like. I started to appreciate the slow character development of the 4 main characters as well. I burned through each episode, wanting to know more about their past, their motivations, and how they got to where they currently are.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In my early 30's, I felt vulnerable after a breakup, but learning to accept my emotions and who I am as a person. I gave Cowboy Bebop another watch, something to take me away from this world, something to remind me of better times.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I never really like episodic type shows, but for Cowboy Bebop, I don't mind it. I didn't have to commit to watching more than one episode per sitting so I can take my time, yet there's enough story and character development to pull me into the next episode if I want. Every character is nuanced and has a past that you want to know more and more as each episode melts into the next. The world building really stood out now as the show completely pulls me into their universe, making me regret being born too early to be a space cowboy.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The character development is more impactful as well. Rather than having young characters that grow and change into better versions of themselves, we have characters who have already experienced the weariness of life. You see glimpses of their past through flashbacks, but not too much as to obstruct the main story. This didn't appeal to my younger self, but now I completely feel for them and their experiences. Whether it's Mai, who's trying to find her way through life, Spike, who's got a dark past he's trying to escape, or Jet, the father figure with a broken heart, they all have some sort of past that defines who they are, yet not hold them stagnant. Life moves on, and they know it. They have to face their past, sooner or later. The way the show builds up to these moments are very well done.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Every time I watch Cowboy Bebop, I notice something new, I appreciate something different about it, and I gain a little bit more perspective on myself and life. Maybe in 10 years, when I watch it again, I'll appreciate something different about this.

            Wow. I don't think there's a show that has completely won me over after an initial bad impression like this show did. When I started the first couple of episodes, I enjoyed them for the most part but didn't really get the appeal, and as the series went on, I started questioning why it is so highly regarded as it is. There was no perceivable overarching plot that invested you in the story and to me there didn't seem to be any interesting character development. By about the midway point I started questioning whether I would actually finish it. But since I have sort of
            <span id="review349142" style="display: none;">
             an obsessive nature that doesn't allow me to stop in the midway point of nearly anything, I continued to forge ahead. I don't know if I just wasn't picking up on stuff in the first half of the show, but I liked the second half of the show way more. More of the episodes have interlinking themes and ideas and many of them take on a slightly darker, more serious tone that works really well. They also build off of the first half of the show really well. Each character, even Ed, is able to dig into their past and we're able to understand each of them more as characters.
             <br>
              <br/>
              Here I want to talk about each of the four main characters individually, starting of with Spike. I found it really interesting and cool that even though he's pretty much the main character of the show, he doesn't take up too much screen time. They way his backstory is revealed feels a little rushed since it's mostly revealed at the end of the show, hurting the emotional impact its implications have on the events that take place in the show. That's more a problem with the pacing of the show though. This goes for every character. The character development is very slow and you gradually learn a little bit more about them each episode. The show is a extremely slow burn in that sense, allowing the events the characters' experience tell you about them rather than exposition. At first I didn't really like that aspect, but it works wonders for the second half of the show. A large reason of why I liked the second half so much was because of how the more nuanced approach to the characters impacted how you understood them. Spike's arc is very bittersweet, but more bitter than sweet. Without spoiling anything, I have to say I was not expecting the ending of the show. You really do "carry that weight" after the ending. Jet is a pretty static character for the most part. We do get some glimpses into his past life, but as a character he doesn't really change much. I really loved Faye's growth as a character. The show got really interesting once it got to exploring her past and how she would deal with it. The way the show conveys her inner struggle about not knowing who she is or where she belongs is dealt with really well. Lastly, although I view Ed pretty much as a glorified plot device, I actually really liked her character as well. She doesn't have any character development either, but I found her characterization to be really enjoyable and funny and I really liked how she exited the show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Although I have some issues with the pacing of the story, for instance there are entire episodes spent on the crew accidentally getting high on mushrooms and fighting black goo, the episodes that impact the overall plot are really well done. And I mean, even the less important episodes are still entertaining to an extent and some of them help expand what we know of the characters.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As to the animation, there's really nothing to say other than that it's amazing. I've said this before, but I really love the aesthetic of older animated shows and films. There's a grittier feel to them that has been lost in the predominantly digital environment of the animation industry. Also, the use of CGI in the show is impeccable. It's used sparingly, but when it is used, it's incorporated flawlessly.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As a last note, I really vibed with the predominantly jazz soundtrack. It really fit the atmosphere of the show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This show won me over big time. Honestly, I wouldn't mind watching a random episode from the show every now and again in the future, even the one's that aren't as important. Still a bit upset about the ending though. I didn't really understand Spike's overall arc, so I read up a bit on it and man, some things just suck.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              See You Space Cowboy.

            Cowboy Bebop is really one of the few animes out there that no one should pass up the opportunity to watch. I really fell in love with it, and it's revered as one of the best animes of all time. If you enjoy sci-fi with a mixture of action and comedy, I highly recommend this series. It's truly a timeless classic!
            <br>
             <br/>
             What I really enjoyed about this anime is that it really makes you think long and hard about what's important in life. The theme of how one perceives the world around them is quite the backbone to the story's overall arc and purpose. The characters
             <span id="review298519" style="display: none;">
              often find themselves wanting purpose, to explore the unknown, and to capture moments through their daily adventures and "bounties."
              <br/>
              There's all kinds of different perspectives the series incorporates, which allows the viewer to think of situation in a whole new light. It also develops many dramatic and lethargic scenes to promote realism—that every day or outcome is not always a happy-go-lucky one, and allows the viewer to appreciate the complexities of one's existence. Similarly, Cowboy Bebop also artistically involves "dreams", or mentally-intriguing qualities that often leave you guessing, or allowing the viewer to clarify in their own ways.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The series has very few, if any "filler episodes", and without a doubt has one of the best soundtracks out there. Complimenting the theme of the series, the soundtrack includes mostly bebop and blues with little elements of gothic and baroque, electric blues, synthesized music, and even some references to Arabic folk.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall, you should definitely watch this series if you're looking for an epic masterpiece. It's delightful space opera film noir appeal will both delight and intrigue you. It will forever be on the top of my list of animes, and with all of its qualities mentioned above along with futuristic settings, new perspectives on life, and humorous, lovable characters, it's hard not to like "Cowboy Bebop."
              <br/>
              <br/>
              See you, Space Cowboy...

            What is the measure of a classic?
            <br>
             <br/>
             The dictionary would suggest that a classic is: n. is an outstanding example of a particular style; something of lasting worth or with a timeless quality; of the first or highest quality, class, or rank – something that exemplifies its class. Something that stands the test of time, is remembered fondly, and has continued appeal.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Historically, the world classic itself typically imbues a connotation of antiquity- Greeks, Romans, ancient literature, artwork, even music. It inspires originality and derives from that a long-lasting impact.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The audience would likely suggest a less abstract definition and instead give examples. In film, you'd
             <span id="review258305" style="display: none;">
              get a Citizen Kane or a Sunset Boulevard or a Rear Window. In television, a wider range of things.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              There are even such things as "modern classics", like my beloved Ringtone Rap.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In anime, the definition of classic- well... that debate is still hotly contested. One name, that continually rises up through sifting of the ever growing mound of coarse sand that is anime however, is that of Cowboy Bebop.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Bebop checks off all the boxes for an enduring, beloved series- it has the characters, it's easy to follow, it's got the tunes, a tightly controlled artistic direction that sets it apart from the rest of the pack, and most importantly- it's entertaining. There is a reason why certain shows like Seinfeld, Spongebob, Andy Griffith, The Flintstones, Friends, Star Trek, and many others continued to air on TV long after their expiration date: accessibility. Many of the longest running shows on television center on a long running, slow unfolding story arc, often involving a large family or group of them- such as Dallas, the Sopranos, or Game of Thrones. They tell interwoven stories with a myriad of characters over a period of years, and as such, length of the show is hampered only by the creative output of the creators.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              To create such a show that, within its relatively short length of 26 episodes (everything listed above numbers in the hundreds of episodes, or will, by the end of the run) manages to cover such a wide range of topics and stories in a self contained format is a feat indeed. One of the most common criticisms of scripted shows like this are their episodic or short arc nature. The people want a singular story to follow- a goal, a direction. Episodic series often feel uneven in tone and pacing, not to mention disjointed due to the constant shift and restarting that's necessary to keep the show accessible to new viewers who may not have seen previous episodes.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop doesn't necessarily rely on viewers to have seen all of the preceding episodes to be able to enjoy any given episode, and to me, this is one of the great charms the show has- the ability to pick it up wherever, and enjoy it. I think this is also why it's had lasting success on Adult Swim since its original airing in 2001. Bebop is a lot of fun to watch, no matter where in the series you pick it up; and that enjoyability is due in no small part to the writing and direction. Certain long running shows can have very interesting plots, and be loaded with poorly written characters, but still manage to garner a large viewing audience who want to follow along- shows that have intriguing concepts, but poor execution.
              <br/>
              For an episodic series like Bebop to succeed, the emphasis doesn't necessarily need to be on making every single story plot the most interesting and wacky thing out there, but rather to be anchored by /characters/ you want to watch interact and react to situations. Indeed, it is characters that drive this story, and not the other way around.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              A show's greatest sin is to be unentertaining. If a show is "boring", it has failed at its' most fundamental level- being entertainment.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Boring, Bebop is not. The characters are unique, and how they work, play, and fight together is decidedly endearing. Each character has their charm and their wit. Spike, the central protagonist, is a mysterious James Bond-esque man of many skills- particularly in combat. Throughout the show, there are several overarching questions about his past, which are revealed through about 5 episodes throughout. However, this kind of information about the character is really just a bonus, because it takes all of one episode to know what kind of character he is: the sharp dressing, sardonic, quintessential cool- cigarettes, guns and all. He's not without depth or flaws, however. There's more behind the man than the mask of calm, cool, and collected.
              <br/>
              He is set opposite the very antithesis of calm, cool and collected in Faye- a beautiful young woman with an equally mysterious past that's explored in several later episodes. She plays an important role in the team though, instead of just being the token female or there for fanservice. She's another multifaceted character with more than meets the eye, and frequently steals the spotlight.
              <br/>
              The trio is rounded off with Jet- the "I'm too old for this crap" retired cop archetype. Jet exists as the grounded personality between Spike's frustration and Faye's outbursts, and generally serves as the voice of reason between the two extremes: his crewmates, hothead and impulsive.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Soundwise, the show is superb. I make no secret of being a fan of Yoko Kanno, but this is the show that catapulted her to stardom in the anime industry. It's got a fantastic blend of moody orchestral pieces juxtaposed with the titular bebop jazz. There's funk, there's electronica, and there's even an episode devoted to heavy metal. A more diverse soundtrack you are unlikely to find, and there will certainly be something for everyone to enjoy with such a variety of tunes. As far as the voice acting goes, Steve Blum, Wendee Lee, and Beau Billingslea all do fantastic jobs as Spike, Faye, and Jet respectively.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The art, too, is fantastic for the time. In 2017, Bebop could be considered an "old" anime, clocking in at a geriatric 19 years of age. Don't let the number fool you though, as the hand drawn art maintains a great consistency in quality and fluidity throughout the show's run. The show features a great variety in locales, vehicles, and characters. Due to the episodic nature, very few episodes take place in the same locations, and a number of different themes in art direction show up in the show. There are full on neo-noir episodes, complete with the black and white look, detectives, etc. and other more darkly colored ones with slow fades to reveal a what looks to be a puddle is actually blood. There are a number of western themed episodes, mafia, casino, and others. Definitely no shortage of different motifs.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              One of my favorite episodes was the magic mushroom episode, where, due to a food shortage, Spike, Faye, and Jet all end up eating psychedelic mushrooms they've mistaken for portabellas, and it's up to Edward to actually track down some real food. Though it's a silly episode played for laughs, it actually succeeds in taking a needed break from the action. The "Pierrot Le Fou" episode, which reminded me heavily of the 1992 Batman Animated series, involves a superhuman test subject that resembles The Penguin, who loses his mind and goes nuts, attacking anyone and everyone. The episode is downright creepy, and Spike's showdown with him at the end is quite clever, and, as mentioned before- really seems like a Batman episode.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              That said, and being episodic, some episodes are a mixed bag. A few that are supposed to be touching just felt a bit out of place, and others that were more comedic in tone fell a bit flat when it involved someone other than the main three. The recurring "Spike and Faye manage to screw up somehow and lose the bounty they're hunting, or they unexpectedly die" gag wears thin pretty quickly, and the formulaic nature of the first few episodes gets kinda old, too. The second half of the show is definitely where it all comes together though, and the ending was rather unexpected for a show of this type, and succeeded in grabbing me by the heart.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              All that to say: Cowboy Bebop is exactly what I would consider to be a classic.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              See you, Space Cowboy.

            First review here, new to MAL, and maybe not read that much. But still, allow me to give my point.
            <br>
             <br/>
             At the time of watching Cowboy Bebop, I was watching animes since a lot of time, and I was watching many at the same time. The kind of period when you were following more than the half of the series in a season. Finally I got tired of that, and the enjoyment was not the same. And then I wanted to watch Cowboy Bebop.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Why is Cowboy Bebop such a great anime? Why is it considered as a masterpiece? I wanted to know, I wanted to be
             <span id="review201656" style="display: none;">
              part of it -if there was something to be a part of. But still, I couldn't forget Angel Beats. All my friends were telling me "man, it's so awesome". Well, check it out, it got only a 5 on my list. I'm not THE guy, but still, I was bored by this "masterpiece", or whatever my friends were telling me.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So what, I started Cowboy Bebop, let the magic do its stuff alright? So I was in. It's nice, I like it. I don't see any masterpiece here but hey, who cares, we'll see later. Oh the episode is already finished? Well, I played the second. And the third. And again and again. Watching the show wasn't that amazing. But I was so in it... When the last episode finished, I understood. I realized I watched something amazing. I haven't felt something like that since my first shots with series like Steins;Gate or Madoka.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Let me explain more: everything is just perfectly right, at the right time, with the right tempo and the best way to do it. It's not just something remarkable that you can point out, like SAO's first season is wonderful, but the ALO season is quite useless and really bad. Everything here is just fucking right (forgive me).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The story is wonderful, from the start to the end, including every background introduced. This is a point were old series can be boring, because the pace is slow, there are useless episodes. In Cowboy Bebop, forget it. Every episode is right, and the progression is really good. When you finish an episode, you sure want the next one. So it's a 10 I guess.
              <br/>
              The sound is fantastic. Why? Because it's jazz and blues. What could be cooler than that? Seriously guys, the sound design is great, and the soundtrack is 20% cooler than any other. Go for it! And thank you Yoko, I love you.
              <br/>
              The characters. Well, it goes with the story to me, mostly because each character has a good personnality, they understand each other, their interactions are right. They are deep, they smoke (oh my god they smoke it's so cool! I don't but it's so fucking cool!)... I don't know what to say, they're perfect! They just fit right in the global atmosphere of the show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It's obviously an overall 10. No less. Because when you start Cowboy Bebop, you finish Cowboy Bebop. It's just amazing, and you have to realize it, at least when you finish it.

            As a guy who only recently started having real interest in anime I've tried to create a list of very good animes to start my anime quest and set a good standard, and Cowboy Bebop is certainly one that will be remembered by me for many years to come.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Nobody I knew watched it, I had no idea of what to expect, except for a good soundtrack, and it was all a new experience to me. I'm usually more interested in fantasy stuff, with superpowers or supernatural beings, but I certainly did not miss that while watching Cowboy Bobop.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             At first glance Spike was the
             <span id="review195401" style="display: none;">
              skinny guy with weird hair who tried to look cool and just looked bored most of the time and Jet was the strong guy who had to make up for his partner's laziness and do most of the thinking, but this was not the case. As the seemingly completely disconnected episodes pass, we get to see much more of their pasts and what led them to become what they are now, and it does not happen over 1 or 2 episodes and bam, you know eveything, it builds up from episode to episode, finding out bit by bit about everyone's past.
              <br/>

              Faye Valentine and "Radical" Ed are the other 2 members of the Bebop's 4 people crew (not forgetting about the lovely dog named Ein). Faye is a woman that can really take care of herself (most of the times) and has an easy time losing all her money through bad gambling or being held at gunpoint by strange people. Ed is a really weird girl who happens to work much better with her computer than with people, but she is an interesting character whose naivety and disconnection with the situations actually play for her.

              I personally liked the second part of the 26 episodes more. Perhaps it took a few episodes for the characters to build on me? The combination of excellent jazzy soundtrack with unexpected situations and people you don't know very well engaging in unique bounty hunting from episode to episode on different places of the solar system is something you will probably love or hate. I loved it, and the last episode surely made me shed one manly tear (okay, 2 tears).

            Cowboy Bebop sets the bar. I take that back; it's nonsense to set the best as a standard. Not only does it put many others in its genre to shame, but many Hollywood productions should also cower in fear of this magnificent masterpiece.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Bebop's episodic nature is exemplary of what artists can do with anime. It has story arcs, but it also has independent episodes like the throwback to Alien and the terrifying one about Pierrot Le Fou. This flexibility allowed its artists to explore a wide variety of themes while maintaining consistency. The storycraft occasionally walks a fine line between detail and ambiguity at times,
             <span id="review175693" style="display: none;">
              much like film noir of old, but it never feels muddled. From the iconic Swordfish spaceship to the space casinos, the cyberpunk and "used universe" atmosphere is realized by the art, which really brings the believable near-future world to life.
              <br/>
              Furthermore, Watanabe's direction is truly masterful; each episode feels complete and whole, and the series has great pacing as well. Watanabe also provided brilliant direction to action sequences, with fights paying homage to Bruce Lee and breathtaking chase scenes.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Great characters are essential to a character-driven plot, and Cowboy Bebop shines in this regard. The series features amazing characters that build on archetypes with their own twists. Their backstories work in tandem with the archetypes, which makes them all the more memorable and not mere caricatures. Character interactions are relatable and meaningful, always with genuine chemistry.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The series' music deserves a special section all of its own. Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts really made a timeless hit with every single song they wrote for Bebop. The soundtrack prominently features jazz such as the iconic OP "Tank!" but also slow-paced blues and even pop music. It is difficult to write about music, as preferences in thus is such a basic if not primal sensation. The most I can say is that if you like jazz and blues, you will fall in love with the soundtrack immediately; if not, you really might start liking these genres.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This series had the gall to include the line "and the work which has become a genre unto itself shall be called: Cowboy Bebop" in the OP. The nerve of them to do that...and yet I find myself wholeheartedly agreeing with them. Cowboy Bebop is the ultimate combination of a great storyline, endearing characters, amazing music, and you will never watch anything quite like it. This is undoubtedly a classic, and my favorite anime series of all time.

            "Whatever your past, you still have a future."
            <br>
             <br/>
             One of the main characters Spike, says this in a particular episode of this series. This line stayed with me throughout the rest of the series &amp; resonated during certain episodes. Eventually, this line formed what I thought was the big question that forms the plot of this of the show: Can you truly feel alive and have a future if you are constantly reminded of the past and how corrupted the world maybe you yourself are?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             This question surrounds the main characters (Spike, Lee, Faye, and Edward) and some secondary characters they meet as they travel the galaxy
             <span id="review200453" style="display: none;">
              hunting criminals with bounties on a ship called The Bebop. Each main character has interesting personalties and mysterious pasts that gradually get revealed as the series goes on.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Spike is a tough, aloof guy with impulsive tendencies who can handle a gun, pilot a ship, and do martial arts. He is also empathetic in toward others in a big brother kind-of way. Jet is a pilot and mechanic who equally tough with guns, level headed (rarely impulsive) and empathetic in a fatherly way. Faye is a woman who is frivolous with money, has avoidance tendencies, and can handle a gun and won't hesitate to use her feminine charms to make other men drop their guard. Last but not least, Ed is an androgynous and energetic genius hacker who is very free-spirited and child-like.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As for the secondary characters, many are notable because they either serve as commentary on the real world in and/or they are sympathetic. One example is an animal rights group that threatens to turn people into monkeys unless they stop hunting a certain animal. Another notable aspect of the secondary characters is that they are diverse in body, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, and personality. The depiction of gay and intersex people in this anime is really progressive when you consider that the anime was made in the late 90's. Also, the way many dark-skinned characters are sprinkled throughout the anime is nice too b/c they are rarely seen in anime.

              Besides the plot and characters, the world building is really creative because it mixes several genres including spaghetti westerns, sci-fi, noir, and in one episode slasher films. This created the major themes of the anime (nostalgia and freedom) and makes you want to keep watching to see what the characters will encounter next.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In addition to the plot, characters, and world building, the soundtrack is incredible. Composed by Yoko Kanno, the soundtrack is rooted in jazz (specifically bebop jazz), but also features other genres like heavy metal and a dash of J-Pop. The fast-paced upbeat bebop jazz really compliments action scenes well. Furthermore, the opening title theme &amp; its visuals are truly striking and memorable.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Last but not least, the animation is really beautiful at times and not so beautiful at others. The beautiful moments  are focused on the sky, like in one scene where Spike is smoking while watching the sunset. The not-so-beautiful moments come during the jump to hyperspace.
              <br/>

              Overall, this was a really entertaining and enjoyable anime. If you are interested in sci-fi or saw Samurai Champloo first like I did &amp; enjoyed it, then give this anime a try.

            Story
            <br>
             Many times have I visited Cowboy Bebop, and every time we've parted company I leave with a sense of how great a conversationalist Cowboy Bebop truly is. How it tells beautiful stories with nothing but ink, paint, computers, and sound. How it seems to transcend it's own media and become something unto itself. Nothing to be worshiped or canonized, but to be viewed with a measure of respect, and perhaps awe, that such a thing ever took place at all.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop, that's the story. There are cowboys and there is bebop, set against the backdrop of the future and space. The series concerns itself with
             <span id="review224147" style="display: none;">
              the lives of Jet Black, Spike Spiegal, Faye Valentine, and Ed. The series itself tends to revolve around sorting out each characters past and reconciling it with their present selves. What sets Cowboy Bebop apart from similar series such as Outlaw Star is that these stories are actually interesting.

              Animation
              <br/>
              Animation directors strive for different goals. Some, like Hayou Miyazaki seek a balance between we humans and nature. The director of Ghost in the Shell, Mamoru Oshii forewarned us that advancement without restraint presented dillemas with no solutions. Shincihiro Wantanbe gave us, with Cowboy Bebop, twenty-six pictures of a world coming to terms with its past. The methods vary, with death, resignation, and an eyes wide shut attitude dominating. But never are these heady themes forced upon us with a heavy hand. They are at many times hidden behind sharp humor, attention to detail, and jaw dropping animation. Only two times are these themes truly brought to a head: at the twelfth and thirteenth episodes (parts one and two of Jupiter Jazz), and episodes twenty-five and twenty-six (parts one and two of The Real Folk Blues). And at these moments the music gets better, the animation sharper, and like true climactic moments, they stay with us long after we finish watching them.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              For it's time, Cowboy Bebop was about as good as television animation got. The style was classically anime, big eyes no nose, small mouth. The fighting animation is very fluid and detailed. But what most impressed me about Cowboy Bebop's animation was the variety of locals, and the lived in natures of every environment that is visited. From the Bebop itself, with its endless rooms and corridors to variety of ethnic architecture, it is truly a treat to behold. The computer graphics are dated by today's standard, but for its time was cutting edge.

              Sound
              <br/>
              Never before or since has such a catalog of music been assembled for an anime, any anime. The principle creator of Cowboy Bebop's music, Yoko Kanno, took the high-road. She hopped from genre to genre in leaps and bounds while never taking from the animation itself, but infusing it with a pulse that at all times seemed perfect. Sometimes characters are defined through music, like Gren, whose sax playing pronounces him melancholy, disillusioned, and cavalier. Three original soundtracks were put together for this anime, each one is distinct and non-repetitious. Listening to them on their own gives you new appreciation on the quality of Yoko Kannos gift.

              Characters
              <br/>
              Characters from Cowboy Bebop each have stories to tell. Each deals with its past and present as best they can, although often times not very well at all. The plot is linear as far as the time line is concerned, but there isn't a penultimate goal sought after. In terms of the classic definitions of conflict, Cowboy Bebop tends towards the man versus himself, or man versus man types of conflict. The principles of Cowboy Bebop do not seek paradigm shifts, do not seek to change the world for the better or worse, but simply to live to see another day. This struggle to live on is what makes Cowboy Bebop so enjoyable, and what gives a humanity to the principle characters that they would otherwise lack.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall
              <br/>
              The concept of Cowboy Bebop is not original, but its execution is outstanding. The characters are not original, but how they interact with the world around them is. The music can be defined by genre, but the impact on the individual cannot. The animation has been topped over the years, the cgi definitely shows its age, but there are still moments of raw beauty that are still unparalleled. Cowboy Bebop is not a rite of passage in anime fandom, but it should be a signpost, showing you the difference between the sublime and the ordinary.

            Hmm...what to say about Cowboy Bebop. Well, it's definitely a show that has it's ups and downs. Sometimes you'll watch it and be like "this episode sucks" and other ones will have you at the edge of your seat/couch. The antics of the main characters are hilarious but underneath their humerous appearance lay hidden secrets and sad pasts. Like most anime, it has it's action scenes and love scenes. It's worth watching if you can get past a few of the not so exciting episodes. But like I said, there's only a few that the series could do without. In the end howevere, it's worth
            <span id="review86" style="display: none;">
             watching.

            Cowboy Bebop is the result of a perfectly mixed drink. On the surface, it’s a futuristic space western about a ragtag group of bounty hunters during their adventures and misadventures. If you take a closer look, however, you will see sprinkled throughout a perfect mix of genres: dashes of horror, comedy, crime, romance, tragedy, philosophy, action, and parody all combined into one neat package. Each episode is a little different from the others by following the same cast of characters from all facets and angles. With each unique episode comes its own strain of music; from tribal drums and chants to electronic pulses. And yet
            <span id="review135989" style="display: none;">
             each song and episode somehow always fills you with the emotions that come with its namesake: bebop, blues and jazz. Despite airing around 15 years ago, Cowboy Bebop has continued to hold its place as one of the greatest anime shows ever to be created, a fact cemented by its vast array of awards and the legacy that followed in its wake.
             <br>
              The brew that is Cowboy Bebop gets is aroma and flavor from its cast of characters. At first glance, they are a strange group of characters that are only in bounty hunting for the quick cash so they can eat. As the series progresses, the characters are slowly revealed and their intentions known. You first think Spike to be a slacker who does the bare minimum on the job, only to learn later of his past in the criminal underground and the loss that killed him emotionally. Jet is the gruff authority figure until you realize he cares deeply for the crew as family. Faye is your typical wild and free female lead but only because her deep set tragic background has forced her to push away any sort of relationship. Ed is an amazing hacker prodigy who has no rhyme or reason until you learn of her past and deprived childhood. The diverse casting, build up, and execution provides a strong set of personalities that the viewer is easily able to get behind and root for.
              <br>
               This blend of a show solidifies itself a diverse soundtrack and fluid animation, even by today’s standards. Each of the 26 episodes have a certain spunk to them, whether they be comedy or tragedy. Some argue that one season’s worth is hardly enough to really flesh out what this series could have been. While this may be true, this series does a splendid job of mixing itself into one strong, dynamic, and satisfying experience that caps itself off just at the peak of its ability.

            I thought I'd try writing a review for once, and also for an anime I have sort of complicated feelings on so here goes!
            <br>
             <br/>
             I enjoyed Cowboy Bebop a lot more than most anime, so it was by no means unenjoyable. However, I never liked it as much as a lot of people and also by comparison to a lot of really popular anime so I'm going to try and pinpoint the reasons for that.. it's still a very entertaining anime though make no mistake!
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Basically, it just comes down to not really being a big fan of the characters at times.. Spike is kind of
             <span id="review184551" style="display: none;">
              a bit easygoing for me, Jet is kind of a bit stiff, Ed is kind of too random, Faye is sort of greedy.
              <br/>

              Well ok, Faye is pretty cool, it's true, then Ed..  but overall I the biggest thing was that Cowboy Bebop kind of starts off insanely slow and is very, very cautious
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Now, that is, on the one hand, appealing! Certainly Cowboy Bebop is one of the more engaging anime for that reason, but when things often had a kind of filler-y approach for the most part.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The story moves around a lot, basically Spike and Jet are perpetually out of $ because they keep almost failing to get so-and-so or such-and-such, as a consequence the anime is more about the banter and character experiences as much as the big mega moments involving old hatreds or new optimism or whatever it is.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Like, ok, it's a unique blend of different worlds, it's fantastical, it's realistic, it's sensible and boisterious, it's a strong personality, it's Cowboy Bebop, but, the best? Hmm I mean consider there are lots of really engaging anime out there.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Ok, lets make a deal, and put Cowboy Bebop up there, but the movie much more resonant in many ways, it incoporated the cool things about the anime and kind of squished it into something that didn't feel like it dragged as much.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall, I can't say I hated Cowboy Bebop, it just felt like the experiences of emotional high were few and far and in between, thus, an 8 (ah screw it, I'll just give it a 9)

            Cowboy Bebop. The show that makes you feel so bad ass you rob a bank, kill a hooker, and inject steroids right into your cock! The show that will have you sayin see you space cowboy after every episode and right when the credits roll you start up the next episode like the fat piece of glorious shit you are. I know im a lil late to the party but I wanted to review this gem since it's one of my favorites and all. So lets get into the review ladies, gentlemen, transgenders, and all people who identify as a trans queer Doppelganger Mc Flurry
            <span id="review224451" style="display: none;">
             Feminist Neo Nazi because im not trying to offend anyone, please don't hurt me. By the way, this contains spoilers if you're the 1 out of 10 people who has not seen Cowboy Bebop yet.

              Story:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In all honesty I didn't get into Cowboy Bebop for it's story line, sure it was there but that's not what drew me in, it was the action baby! This isn't to say the story is bad I loved how it was episodic. In fact for it's time this was something unique and different. I liked how every episode was a different adventure and it felt fresh with new and amazing characters and new people joining the main crew and sort of becoming a family of sorts if you wanna call it that. The only gripe I had was that the ending felt sort of unsatisfying for me and this really is just my opinion but I felt like it was sort of rushed and what I mean is that end fight with Vicious felt lame af, how you gonna let that nigga kill you and you got a pistol when he had a close range weapon? You managed to get a shot on that fool! He wasn't invincible and you could of brought a machine gun up in there and blasted his ass sky high! Naw im playin it was a good ending, the bang at the end was cool and all that shit. 9/10

              <br/>
              The animation was fantastic, you aren't gonna get anything this good these days. Now most shit consists of low budget CGI (Im looking at you berserk 2016!), I feel like all anime looks alike nowadays (THATS RACIST) but it's like everything is drawn so cutesy, one reason I can't watch DBZ Super even tho i really want to just the dub needs to hurry the fuck up, Japs voices always trigger my great grandpas PTSD so i can't watch it. But anyways the art is great, love Fayes Tits. 9/10

              <br/>
              <br/>
              The voice acting and musical score in this show is godly. It's like experiencing sex with Sophia Vergara while Beyonce makes out with you and Lisa Ann fondles your ball sack and fingers your butt hole all at once! Never have I heard English voice acting this good not even today. It all sounds like shit with a few exceptions here and there like a minor bit of Funimations work but it still doesn't compare. And that lovely Jazz music is the cherry on top of this beautiful sundae. 10/10

              Spike has to be one of my favorite MC's of all time. He's in my top 10 list and for good reason. Who doesn't love a space bounty hunter with a dark past and a humorous attitude? Jet's also a cool dude who can cook a mean bell peppers and beef (hold the beef). Faye is the bad ass chick every show needs one of those for boobs and what not, she has a cool backstory. And then there's Ed.... wtf is that a boy or a girl? That bitch would have professor Oak give up raising Pokemon just to figure out the gender of this nigga. Oh yeah and there's Ein the dog, he barks and shit. 10/10

              Enjoyment:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So, did I enjoy Cowboy Bebop? Does Kim Kardashian finger Kanyes butt hole? Is Xvideos better than porn hub? Did my father leave me at a young age because I was a failure as a son? I didn't just enjoy Cowboy Bebop, this was the first show i legit jerked off to, it took me on a ride ill never forget and it made me so erect my cock broke through space and time itself. I've never been on a trip like this ever since I took acid back in high school. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will most definitely maintain an erection for more than 5 hours. 10/10

              <br/>
              <br/>
              would be an 11 if this rating system wasn't shit.

            As a fairly new anime fan I obviously started with some of the most recommnded shows, and Cowboy Bebop was one of the first. This show is considered a masterpiece thanks to the alleged fascinating characters, outstanding story and amazing music.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Let's start with the latter- the Jazz soundtrack is really cool, though not notable or memorable in most of the parts. The openening theme is super cool, and I almost never skipped it (a thing I usually do).
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The show has a nice background story- after an accident in the hyperspace the Earth became uninhabitable, and humanity colonized the other planets and moons of
             <span id="review217164" style="display: none;">
              the solar system. Meanwhile, crime rates have risen, and bounty hunters help the police catch criminals. In short- a fair setting for a space western. There are indeed some beautiful views and space battle scenes in here.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The problems begin when the story starts being told. First, like most in of the shows in which the episodes' plots aren't tightly connected, troubles tend to get fixed to quickly. A more major problem is that the first 10 episodes are absolutely boring! If the show wasn't considered a must-watch classic that luckily has only one season, I probably wouldn't have gone past them. The 11th episode is a turning point in the manner of the plot quality, altough such episode was probably made in every show with a spaceship ever.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              But eventually, the biggest cause for my personal relative unenjoyment was the thing that the show is most praised for- the characters. It is true that all the main characters have mysterious troubled pasts that are explored throughout the show. However, because we know nothing of them at the beginning of the show, and their backstories are revealed way to slowly, I couldn't find even a small piece of interest in any of the characters until the very last episodes. For example, Jet's past which was the first to be revealed, is actually quite an uninteresting unoriginal cliche. Around episode 20 I realized that my favorite character is actually Ein the dog! Combining that with the boring first 10 episodes, I got a show that I would likely drop in an early stae unless I was feeling obligated to watch it until the end as a so called classic.
              <br/>
              Also, I was really bothered by the unproportional bodies of Spike and Faye, or more specifically- their extermely long legs.

            I think Cowboy Bebop is overrated. OK now fans of the 90's with your torches and pitchforks calm down and let me have my own opinion. personally, while I do see why people love this anime I think they're reading too much into it and worse, some of them overhype it to such a degree that other better anime in my opinion suffer from unjust criticism. Note that if you like it a lot, fine I respect your opinion, I really do, nor do I think less of anyone who does. Just don't call me immature just because I don't like it because, I am
            <span id="review84087" style="display: none;">
             NOT an idiot. OK?
             <br>
              <br/>
              Now why didn't I like it? I can't simply list the stuff I liked and didn't like so I'll review the show as a whole. Everyone says that they like it for the characters, animations, simple plot and the narrative which is supposed to be subtle and leaves a lot to the imagination of the viewer.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Animation is very, very good and the action is some of the greatest (well, most of the time. The 'fight' in episode 19 sucked) and the soundtrack, with or without the way it was used is one of the greatest ever. Favorite tracks include Blue, Call me Call me, The Real Folk Blues, Ask DNA and of course Tank!
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Before I talk about the plot, let me talk about the characters. Spike and Faye are without a doubt the most interesting characters in the whole show. Faye herself starts off as a 'femme fatale' character that dislikes men and tries manipulating them for her own wants. We later see what gave her this mind set and her back-story was believable and rather tragic, so much so I actually did feel sorry for her. She does develop a lot through what I deem intense suffering and I like how she gets a crush o Spike. Speaking of Spike, he's also a complex character, one who is fairly sympathetic and compelling. Despite being really lazy and only cares about food and playing pool because he believes life is nothing but a dream, he still searches for and loves his missing girlfriend. OK, so far so good but Spike has a really grating flaw of being very reckless and wild when chasing his bounty. We've seen him engage in dogfights with a lot of his bounty whilst being inside a populated city too many times to count. Because of this, the show states, a lot of the bounty they do get ends up being used to pay for property damage. Oi, writers, what about the hundreds of people Spike accidently massacred? To make this worse, some of the people he is chasing aren't necessarily a threat like Jet's ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend Rint. I mean dude, they were on a cheap boat, stop trying to kill them just because you’re hungry. Geez.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Jet while still complex has a really clichéd back-story and I didn't care much for his character whilst Ed is Ed; she's funny and can even be cute but that’s about it. She doesn't have that much depth as a character. Vicious was an interesting and effective villain though. I actually did want to know more about him and his plans and motivations are actually interesting. The same cannot be said for most of the other villains. Pierrot le Fou as I said was a boring character and his back-story is also really clichéd. I mean come on, how many time have we seen a villain who becomes evil because of torture before? How many villains also have an amusement park of doom as their secret hideout? And is it me or did episode 20 of Bebop have much more fluid animation than usual?
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Now, you'll tell me that Bebop's main appeal isn't the plot so much as the characters who themselves are supposed to be everyday type of people; you'll tell me that Bebop is more about the experience, that it wanted people to feel rather than give them a normal 3 (or 4) act story. Note I love works of fiction that are supposed to be more of an experience and don't necessarily have a plot and I also love different characters. Sadly, I didn't find the world of Bebop or the premise that interesting. I didn't care for the characters that much, I didn't care for the world and I also didn't experience anything from Bebop's story that other anime have given me. The only time I can say I actually felt anything was in episode 24 with the scene where the song Call me plays. I actually did cry at that scene but that’s it. The rest of the series didn't give me anything that would make me feel sad, angry, sick, happy or anything. Yeah, do you remember that scene in episode 26 where a friend of the protagonist dies? Yeah, I didn't cry because I did not care.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              They say that Bebop's narrative style relies not only on the music but also on the lack of back-story, letting people draw up their own conclusions. Draw up conclusions to what? What motivates the characters to act like they do? I guess it did work pretty well sometimes but not all of the time and this is another major flaw I found with Bebop. I didn't care for most of characters because I didn't know a lot about them and what I knew were too vague. In a work of fiction you can't build off a character based on mere hints: we must have a reason to care and the only character I really cared for was Faye as her back-story wasn't clichéd in the least and she was actually interesting.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Even Spike who is an interesting character on his own suffered from me not caring because I didn't get his mindset. What made him believe that life is just a dream? What made him give up on life? What DO Spike and Julia see in each other? No, scratch that, somebody tell me what is so interesting about Julia because other than being Spike's girlfriend and one who cares for him a lot, I don't know much about her. I don't know what Spike sees in her, how they got off and developed their relationship and when things start to take a turn for the worse for them, I found myself not caring because as I said, I didn't have a reason to care about this relationship. In other good anime and manga like Berserk, Rurouni Kenshin, Sankarea, Clannad etc... we actually see the main couple develop feelings for each other over time, so much so that when they do suffer it becomes all the more heartbreaking. Bebop, didn't show Spike and Julia developing. They just got it off (I guess) and pretended to leave their relationship to our imagination. Explain anime, explain!
              <br/>
              <br/>
              With this thought process, am I to assume that Ed became the way she is because she had to roam the world because her father abandoned her? There are plenty of children who are homeless and yet aren't insane so what on earth drove Edward to become like that? Something more sinister maybe...
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I also disagree with the line ''And the work which has become a genre unto itself shall be called: Cowboy Bebop.'' I find it pretentious and non-sensical because no matter how many genres it crammed into its 26 episodes, it didn't explore every genres strengths and devices and in the end it is and will always be a science fiction action show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The absolute worst flaw Bebop has though is the lack of plot and character development and over reliance on filler episodes. The best episodes like Jupiter Jazz, The Real Folk Blues, Hard Luck Woman and of course, Ballad of Fallen angels all had character development or a new revelation about the most interesting characters namely, Spike and Faye. Most of the time though, the show was spent on the 'gang' either tracking a boring clichéd villain (like Pierrot le Fou and the Space eco-terrorists), not very funny comedy antics (Mushroom Samba, Cowboy Funk and Toys in the Attic) and sometimes, I found myself absolutely bored by the show with really pointless episodes (like Speak like a Child and the horrible Wild Horses).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Now, I'm someone whom likes good episodes that don't necessarily advance the plot but instead reveal more about the characters and the world they live in. Cry for the devil was very good and so was My Funny Valentine. Ganymede Elegy was a good episode showing more of Jets back-story and Gateway Shuffle was rather intense and atmospheric. Most of the other episodes weren't like that. My least favorite Bebop episode is Wild Horses: there wasn't an interesting fight scene, the characters introduced were very forgettable and we didn't find out more about the world of Bebop because the episode TOOK PLACE IN A FREAKING DESERT FULL OF UNINTERESTING SAND! The episode before it was just as bad because half of it is just Jet and Spike searching in vain for a VCR in order to play the mysterious video tape Faye received. Some people thought the entire struggle was funny: I thought the writers were too lazy and I don't want to pass through a boring episode like that just to get one sad moment that lasted 3 minutes. Someone told me that episode 19 was important in showing how Spike and Jet's relationship worked and again, I don't want to pass through a boring episode like that only to see two characters exchange a few lines and pretend that I'm seeing something deep.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I think I'd have given the series a much higher rating had it been shorter and most episodes having focused on the plot and character development because when it did focus on the plot, Bebop was amazing and without a doubt those episodes had the best moments and use of music. My final verdict for Bebop is a 7 for good. It's just an action show, a good action show but just an action show. It doesn't deserve a 10 because it's not that deep nor inspiring, nor do I think it  is the masterpiece most fans of the 90's think it is and no, Bebop fans, the worst of Bebop is NOT better than the best of anime. Period. There are plenty of anime that are vastly superior to Bebop in both characterization and writing. However, as I said, it's not horrible or downright bad and it does stay with you.

            Cowboy Bebop, is a masterpiece. Anybody who argues otherwise quite obviously doesn't understand the medium. Cowboy bebop is one of the few shows out there that exists so highly in so many people's lists that it has become like a reference point all other anime is graded out of.
            <br>
             *Person 1* So I just finished Tokyo Weeabho-I mean ghoul.
             <br/>
             *Person 2* Hmm, how many Bebops out of 10 was it?
             <br/>
             *Person 1* Eh, 2-3.
             <br/>
             *Person 2* This analogy is getting old!
             <br/>
             But I think you understand what I mean.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Let me start with the story, a lot of people could argue that CB is just a bunch of filler, and
             <span id="review197467" style="display: none;">
              while they might technically be right, all the filler there serves the purpose of supplying character development which makes the story make sense. It all ties in and that is wonderful.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Art? Pfft, more like heaven's gloriously profound image of god we just found lying around on Toonami one day.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Sound?
              <br/>
              2 words, Yoko Kanno.
              <br/>
              Done.
              <br/>
              NEXT!
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Character development as I stated earlier is an integral element of this, as is Yoko Kanno's stunningly jazzy soundtrack and this is one of the few anime out there that rivals NGE in terms of character depth an portrayal.
              <br/>
              Character development is defined as
              <br/>
              "the change a character undergoes during the course of a story"
              <br/>
              And in most stories this would apply to character that goes from point A (Us knowing nothing about them) to point B (Us knowing something about them)
              <br/>
              But in Bebop they handle it a bit... Smoother, because there are no time stamps at which we know more about them per se.
              <br/>
              I will just say, like Spike's famous fighting style... It's smooth like water.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The enjoyment is so far through the roof I can see the toys in the attic, it's just a fun show.
              <br/>
              Overall Bebop is an absolute masterpiece that needs to be seen by anybody and everybody, even people who don't like anime.
              <br/>
              Watch it and enjoy, it's a wild ride.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              See you, space cowboys ;)
