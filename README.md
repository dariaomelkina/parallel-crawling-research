# Parallel crawling research
Repository with implementation of crawlers from the paper.

## Description:

_DRAFT_

In order for testing of the crawlers to be consistent and representative we have 
set some parameters, which should be the same for all the crawlers:
* **OS (for benchmarking):** Ubuntu (_which one?_)
* **Compiler:** gcc 10.2.0-6 version
* **CMake:** 3.17+ version
